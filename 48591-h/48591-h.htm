whose never-failing nerve serves to carry him through difficulties
that would daunt any ordinary young fellow. Because
of his daring as a racer with bicycle, motor-cycle and automobile
he is known as "Mile-a-minute Matt." Motor-boats,
air ships and submarines come naturally in his line, and consequently
he lives in an atmosphere of adventure in following
up his "hobby."</p>

as well as of heart, who is led by a fortunate accident to link his
fortunes with those of Motor Matt.</p>

but in spite of all that a royal chum, ready to stand by
the friend of his choice through thick and thin.</p>

<p><b>Archibald Townsend</b>, a wealthy though eccentric gentleman, who
owns a remarkable submarine boat on which our friends have
seen various adventures in the past.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE LEVEE.</p>


<p>"Py shiminy grickets!"</p>

<p>"Well, strike me lucky!"</p>

<p>"Can I pelieve vat I see mit my eyes, Tick, or haf I
got der plind shtaggers?"</p>

<p>"I'm guessing good and hard, Carl. It's main queer,
and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Py all der rules oof der game dot feller iss Matt
King, oddervise Modor Matt, oddervise Mile-a-minute
Matt, King oof der Modor Poys und Gaptain oof der air
ship <i>Hawk</i>, aber I bed you I nefer see him like dot pefore."</p>

<p>"It's Matt, all right, but sink me if I'm not taken all
aback by the way he acts. What's come over the old
ship to do like that?"</p>

<p>It was about half-past four in the afternoon, and Carl
Pretzel and Dick Ferral were on their way along the
water front of New Orleans. They had gone into town
on an important errand and were now returning to Stuyvesant
Dock, where their air ship was moored and where
they had expected to find Motor Matt.</p>

<p>Just off the foot of Canal Street a steamer was loading
for False River. Four-mule teams attached to heavy
drays were backed up to the wharf and long lines of darkies
were crossing the gang plank with bags on their shoulders
and recrossing empty-handed for other burdens.</p>

<p>It was an attractive scene for the two boys and they
halted for a few moments to watch; then, suddenly, a big
surprise was sprung on them. They saw Motor Matt,
hands in his pockets, loafing along the levee&mdash;at least they
thought it was Motor Matt, for the lad was of the same
build, the same height and with a face exactly like the
young motorist's. Carl and Dick knew Matt so well that
they were positive they were not mistaken, but there was
something about Matt they could not understand.</p>

<p>In the first place, Matt was slouching along. That
wasn't like him, for as a rule he was as spry as a cricket
in all his movements. Then, again, Matt was wearing a
slouch hat, a dingy red sweater and frayed corduroy
trousers&mdash;all as different as possible from the trim young
motorist in his leather cap and jacket. But&mdash;and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the most incomprehensible thing to Carl and Dick&mdash;Matt
was smoking a cigarette. Now, Motor Matt was down
on cigarettes good and hard, for he knew the havoc they
made with a fellow's constitution, and that no one could
keep in the pink of condition if he used them; and yet,
there he was with one of the rice-paper things hanging
between his lips.</p>

<p>Small wonder Carl and Dick were astounded. If a
small-sized earthquake had happened along and shaken
things up generally the two boys could not have been
more astounded.</p>

<p>Although they were in plain view, yet Matt did not
seem to notice them. For a while they stared&mdash;and then,
abruptly, Dick had an idea.</p>

<p>"He's in disguise," averred Dick.</p>

<p>"For vy iss he dot?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>"It must be he's watching somebody and don't want the
fellow to know who he is."</p>

<p>"Vat a foolishness!" muttered Carl. "He can't make
some disguises unless he geds anodder face. I vould
know dot face oof his anyvere, no madder how he vas got
oop, nor how many cigarettes he shmoked. Ach, du
lieber! I am surbrised ad him, und dot's all aboudt it."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Dick, "this letter of Townsend's is
important and I've got to get it into his hands. If Matt
is watching somebody, the thing is to hand him the letter
without giving him away. Any one seeing us chinning
with him would suspect right away that he was our chum,
for all three of us are pretty well known up and down the
river front."</p>

<p>"Dot's righdt," said Carl. "Ve don'd vant to tip off his
game oof he iss blaying vone. How ve vas going to gif
him der ledder, hey?"</p>

<p>"I guess I can do it, but it won't be any first-chop work.
I'll give a whistle and make him look this way, then I'll
flash the letter, lay it on this bale of cotton, and we'll back
off and give him a wide berth."</p>

<p>"Meppy der feller Matt iss vatching vill see you do
dot?"</p>

<p>"Mayhap, but we've got to run the risk. This letter of
Townsend's, you know, is important and must be acted
upon to-night. Now listen while I pipe up."</p>

<p>Ferral put his fingers to his lips and whistled shrilly.
Several loungers looked toward the two boys, Matt himself
shifting his eyes languidly in their direction. Ferral
at once drew a letter from the breast of his shirt, held it
in front of him, cautiously pointed to it as he looked at
Matt and then laid it on the bale of cotton.</p>

<p>It was far from being cleverly done&mdash;the very nature
of the case, with so many loungers about, put cleverness
out of the question. All Dick hoped for, however, was
that the man Matt was watching might not see the move.</p>

<p>The work of Carl and Dick was built entirely on surmises.
Unable to explain Matt's get-up and actions in
any other way, they surmised that he must be watching
some one; but the biggest surmise&mdash;and which, to the
boys, seemed no surmise at all, but positive reality&mdash;was
that the lad was Motor Matt.</p>

<p>Matt, hands still in his pockets and cigarette between
his lips, shuffled toward the cotton bale.</p>

<p>"We've tipped him off," chuckled Dick, as he and Carl
backed away. "He'll fall afoul of that letter, now, and
it's up to us to give him a good offing. I hope the move
wasn't seen by the swab he's got under his eye."</p>

<p>From a safe distance the two boys watched while
Matt came close to the bale and leaned against it while
he picked up the letter. He was amazingly open and
aboveboard while he examined that letter. Carl and Dick
thought he would sneak it off the cotton bale, tuck it in
his pocket and lounge carelessly away. But they were
mistaken. Matt held the letter up curiously and turned it
around and around in his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, keelhaul me!" growled Dick. "He might just
as well tell everybody what we've done as to examine the
letter like that. There must be a screw loose in his head!
Why, I never saw him act like that before. I can't smoke
his roll any way you put it."</p>

<p>"I vas all mixed oop aboudt it meinseluf," said Carl, in
a puzzled tone. "He iss acting so keveer as I can't tell.
Oof he vas keeping drack oof somepody, vy don'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then something happened that caused Carl to catch
his breath. A startled exclamation escaped Dick.</p>

<p>In a flash the cotton bale had leaped into flame!</p>

<p>Wild shouts came from everywhere on that part of the
levee. Stevedores dropped their burdens, bystanders lost
their passive demeanor and teamsters jumped from their
trucks. Buckets were secured and dipped in the river,
and hustled toward the blazing bale with the water.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Matt had slouched off to a good distance
from the fire. While the boys drew nearer and watched
excitedly, they saw an officer rush up to their chum, seize
the cigarette from his lips and dash it on the planks and
crush it under his foot.</p>

<p>"Can't you read, you idiot?" fumed the officer. "Look
there!"</p>

<p>With his club he pointed to a sign which read, "No
smoking." All over the levee there were signs to that
effect. No matter which way a fellow turned the curt
order, "No smoking," stared him in the face.</p>

<p>"Aw, forget it!" said Matt, with a curt disregard for
legal authority that came to Dick and Carl like a slap in
the face. "You're a copper, all right, but you can't get
gay with me."</p>

<p>This insolence astounded the officer. Likewise it
served to arouse his temper.</p>

<p>"I'll get gay with you, all right, my festive kiskedee,"
he snapped. "That cigarette of yours set fire to that
bale, an' you'll just consider yourself pinched."</p>

<p>The officer's hand dropped on Matt's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You will pinch me, eh?" answered Matt. "Well,
you've got another guess coming!"</p>

<p>With that his languid air vanished in a twinkling and
he became imbued with the fiercest kind of energy. With
a swift leap he wrenched himself free of the policeman's
detaining hand. The policeman, with an angry shout,
jumped at him, swinging his club. Matt's foot went out
and the policeman was neatly tripped and measured his
length on the planks.</p>

<p>This was energy of the kind Motor Matt could display,
upon occasion, but he had never been known to direct it
against an officer of the law. Nor was Motor Matt insolent&mdash;he
had other ways for meeting injustice.</p>

<p>Astonishment at the swift progress of events and the
unheard-of actions of their chum held Carl and Dick
stunned in their tracks.</p>

<p>"He iss grazy!" averred Carl, with a gasp. "Modor
Matt has gone off der chump! He iss pughouse, yah, so
helup me!"</p>

<p>"He's all ahoo in his top hammer and no mistake!"
agreed Dick. "But we've got to help him, Carl. We
can't stand off and on while Matt's in trouble. Avast
there!" he yelled, running toward the exciting scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold back a minute, officer! Sheer off, and keep those
men back!"</p>

<p>The policeman had scrambled to his feet, and stevedores
and bystanders were all making a concerted rush
in Matt's direction.</p>

<p>"Yah, yah," taunted Matt defiantly. "I'm ready for
anything from a fight to a foot race."</p>

<p>He was lightning-like in his movements now. Pulling
over a barrel that stood on end, he rolled it into the
midst of his pursuers. Half a dozen of them went down
in a tangled heap and so interfered with the others that
pursuit was, for a moment, checked.</p>

<p>Matt made the most of this period of grace and ducked
away toward Canal Street. There were two or three
carriages at the edge of the wharf, and by the open door
of one of them a man was standing.</p>

<p>"This way, King!" the man shouted, beckoning.</p>

<p>Carl and Dick saw the fugitive swerve in the direction
of the carriage. Another moment and he and the man
were inside, the door slammed, and the darky on the box
whipped away. In less time than it takes to tell it, the
carriage was lost in a crowd of vehicles, while Dick and
Carl were gasping on the levee, staring blankly into each
other's eyes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MIXED IDENTITIES.</p>


<p>"You're all right, neighbor," panted the fugitive as he
settled back in the carriage seat. "I was in a tight corner,
but the copper hadn't any call to rough things up
with me like he did. How did you happen to be handy
by and willing to give me a lift?"</p>

<p>"I've been watching you for fifteen or twenty minutes,"
answered the man.</p>

<p>"Piping me off, eh? Why was that? What's your graft,
anyhow? Put me wise and oblige."</p>

<p>"Oh, drop it!" said the other disgustedly. "You know
me, all right enough. Look!"</p>

<p>The man wore a black beard. Lifting his hands as he
spoke he plucked it away, revealing a smoothly shaven
face.</p>

<p>"Recognize me now?" he queried, with a husky laugh.</p>

<p>"If I do I'm a geezer," answered the youth. "Why
the bogus wind teasers? Gee, but this is a warm play."</p>

<p>"You make me tired!" scowled the man. "My name's
Whistler, as you know well enough."</p>

<p>"Whistler, Whistler," murmured the fugitive. "On
the level, Whistler, you've got past my guard. But what's
the diff? You're one-two-seven with me for lifting me
out of that bunch of trouble. But, tell me, whose game
of muggins is this, and what's the stake? Anything higher
than two-call-five and a quarter to see puts me out of
the running. You've heard of the bank that broke the
man at Monte Carlo? Well, listen&mdash;I'm It. Please drop
that dizzy front, old fel, and tell me why you're a counterfeit.
Not being a has-wasser myself, I'm game for
anything that promises kopecks, simoleons, or anything
white or yellow with the eagle bird and E Pluribus Get-there
on the side. Have one?"</p>

<p>With two yellow-stained fingers, the youth pulled a
cigarette box from under his sweater and offered it to
the man. The latter, apparently in a daze, shook his
head negatively. With a grin, the fugitive lighted a cigarette
and put away the box.</p>

<p>"Now, Whistler," he pattered, "cut away with the
straight dope and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Whistler narrowed his eyes and studied the fugitive's
face for a minute.</p>

<p>"You've got more tricks in your basket, Matt King,"
said he, "than I've given you credit for, up to now."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Whistler," drawled the youth, "you'll never
hear me putting up a roar when that sort of con talk is
shoved at me. Yes, indeed, I've gathered much knowledge
while knocking about our little planet. Experience
came to me early and says, 'Joe, put your little hand in
mine and let's go out and take a bird's-eye view of the
Universe.' We went. Perhaps that's why, at the present
speaking, I'm in N. O. all but broke. Being bashful
and retiring, I don't like to feature myself; but you're
keen, Whistler, and I couldn't dodge you."</p>

<p>The torrent of language flowed steadily, and as it
flowed Whistler grew more and more surprised.</p>

<p>"Great jumping je-lucifer!" he muttered. "You've
changed a whole lot in the last few days, King. I suppose
that happened when you took to cigarettes?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not according to league rules." The lad allowed
a mouthful of smoke to trickle out through his lips and
nose. "King, eh?" he went on. "How you do keep
handing me the bokays. I was king of the track when
I rode the ponies, king of the plungers when I played
'em, and king of the 'bos now they've broke me. Oh,
yes, call me King by all means."</p>

<p>Whistler, still staring, sat back and mumbled to himself.</p>

<p>"What do you call yourself, <i>now</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A mistake. I took the wrong turn at the forks of
the road. Prosperityville lay on the other track and I'm
just over the hill from the poorhouse. Also I call myself
Dennis, and I spell it M-u-d. When I was christened
they named me Joe, and the other part of it was Dashington.
Generally they referred to me as Dash. That's
about all I amount to, now; just a dash&mdash;a straight line
that ought to stand for something, but don't."</p>

<p>"You're a pretty slick counterfeit yourself, King,"
laughed Whistler. "I never dreamed that Motor Matt
could play himself up like this."</p>

<p>"My, my!" murmured Joe Dashington. "He thinks I'm
stringing him! If I'd been careless with the truth he'd
have believed me; but now that I'm giving it to him
straight, he winks the other eye and drops a mitt on his
left shoulder."</p>

<p>The carriage came to a stop. Joe Dashington started
up and looked through the carriage window.</p>

<p>"Have the cops landed on me?" he inquired, "or have
we reached the place we're going?"</p>

<p>"We've stopped where I wanted to, Motor Matt," returned
Whistler. "Do you see this?"</p>

<p>He lifted a hand from his outside jacket pocket and
showed a glimmering bit of steel.</p>

<p>"Not being blind," answered Dash calmly, "I'm wise to
the pepper box. Ah, ha, the plot thickens! Why the
gun?"</p>

<p>"I said I was watching you, there on the dock," answered
Whistler sternly, "and I was doing it for a purpose.
You were disguised, and I believed then and am
of the opinion now that you were trying to find out
something about me. I intended going to False River
on that boat, but changed my plans when I saw you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
You're going to get out here and accompany me into the
house before which we have stopped; and you're going
to remember, Motor Matt, that this pepper box is in my
pocket all the time, and that I can use it there just as
well as though I had it in sight."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, this is a funny play, but I'm a passenger,
Mr. Whistler, and you seem to hold all the trumps. I
shall be glad to go into the house with you. Johnny
Hardluck has been rubbing my fur the wrong way for
days and days, and I'd get heart failure if he didn't keep
it up."</p>

<p>Whistler opened the door with one hand, and he and
the youth got out of the carriage, crossed the walk,
climbed a flight of steps and vanished into the house.
They were met in the hall by a man who showed a good
deal of surprise.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, Whistler!" fretted the man. "I thought
you were on your way to False River, by now."</p>

<p>"Changed my plan, Jurgens," replied Whistler. "Conduct
us into the front room where the light is better.
I've a surprise for you."</p>

<p>Jurgens gave a sharp look in the fugitive's direction,
turned and led the way into an apartment where the late
afternoon sun rendered objects clearer to the eye.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, startled. "Matt King!" He
whirled angrily on Whistler. "What do you mean by
bringing him here?"</p>

<p>"Don't go off the jump, Jurgens," answered Whistler,
"until you learn more. Bangs went with me to the landing,
and just as I was about to go on the boat I caught
sight of King. I wondered why he was got up like that,
and I believed that he was watching me. While I was
wondering whether I should go on the boat, or not, this
lad turned a little trouble on the levee. Those two chums
of his, the sailor and the Dutchman, signaled and one
of them laid a letter on a cotton bale. King went forward
to get it and a spark from his cigarette fired the
bale. A policeman started after him, and I motioned for
him to come to the carriage. I saw, then, that he didn't
know me. He accepted my invitation and I brought him
away. Now we can make him tell us what his game is,
and we can have a look at that letter."</p>

<p>Joe Dashington listened to all this with a surprised
grin.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to have heart failure over this," he
remarked, "but, somehow, it don't phase me. I can't
be much worse off than I am, no matter what happens.
When you gents find out you've made a sucker play, perhaps
you'll tell me how I can turn enough of the ready
for a board bill and a place to pound my ear."</p>

<p>"He's trying to tell me that his name's not King,"
scoffed Whistler.</p>

<p>Jurgens, deeply interested, laid his head on one side
and studied the youth at some length.</p>

<p>"His face is King's, plain enough," said he finally,
"but he's rigged out like a hoodlum and talks like a beachcomber.
What's the answer?"</p>

<p>"I'm by," laughed Joe Dashington. "You fellows tell
me."</p>

<p>He lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>"Pass over that letter," ordered Whistler.</p>

<p>Dashington, without a dissenting word, handed the
letter to Whistler.</p>

<p>"I know as much about it as you do," said he. "If it's
an invite to go out with a stocking full of sand, please
count me in. Anything with money in it looks good to
me."</p>

<p>The envelope bore the words, "For Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"He's King, easy enough," averred Jurgens, looking
over Whistler's shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's a cinch," averred Whistler, opening the letter
and removing the inclosed sheet.</p>

<p>Together the two men read the letter, managing to
keep wary eyes on the youth as they did so.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Matt</span>: I'm lying ill in bed, out on Prytania
Street. Dick and Carl know the place. There's a bag
of diamonds to be delivered to the daughter of the Man
from Cape Town, over on St. Charles Avenue, and you're
the only one I can trust to do the work. You will have
to be careful about it, and I wish you would come here
at midnight to-night and get the stones. I haven't told
either Carl or Dick what I want you to do, and when you
read this I think you had better keep it to yourself&mdash;even
from them. I've a feeling in my bones that there's
trouble ahead, and I want to get the responsibility of
those diamonds off my shoulders as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours, <span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 5em;">Archibald Townsend</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Exultation flamed in the faces of Whistler and Jurgens.</p>

<p>"Luck!" cried Whistler. "This is our lucky day, Jurgens,
and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Nothing ever dropped into our hands so easy before!"
jubilated Jurgens. "All we've got to do is to think of
some way to pull off the deal and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Feet clattered up the outside steps. Leaving Whistler
to look after the youth, Jurgens darted into the hall.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bangs!" he exclaimed, a moment later.
"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I was down on the levee when Whistler took a fellow
we both thought was Motor Matt into a carriage and
rushed away with him," came the voice of Bangs, as Jurgens
led him into the front room; "but when I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bangs likewise wore a false beard. He was pulling
it off as he came into the room, but suddenly he stopped
and stared. His eyes were on Joe Dashington.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Jurgens curtly.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that chap is a dead ringer for Motor Matt!"
gasped Bangs, pointing to the youth.</p>

<p>"A dead ringer for him?" echoed Whistler. "Why,
Bangs, he <i>is</i> Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought when you rushed away with
him," continued Bangs, "but you hadn't been gone three
minutes when Motor Matt showed up on the levee and
the officer tried to arrest him."</p>

<p>Jurgens and Whistler seemed stupefied. They stared
at each other, then at Bangs, and then at the grinning
face of Dashington.</p>

<p>"If I could see as much as two bones in this, gents,"
remarked the youth, "I'd be tickled out of my kicks.
This Motor Matt must be a beaut if he looks like yours
truly. What's in the letter? Can't we use it some way
and get a strangle hold on a basket of rocks? I've got a
horrible financial stringency staring me in the face, and
I'm ripe for anything."</p>

<p>An idea, just then, laid hold of Jurgens.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed. "Fate must have framed
up this whole play for our especial benefit. Get together,
all of you, and listen to me! I've got a scheme, and it's a
world beater."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DOUBLE-TROUBLE.</p>


<p>Carl and Dick, on the levee, gazed dumfounded at
the points in the press of vehicles where the carriage had
disappeared, and then faced the other way and peered at
the chagrined policeman, the blackened and smoking cotton
bale, and the loungers who were crowding about the
officer. The roustabouts had all gone back to their work.</p>

<p>"Pinch me, vonce!" begged Carl. "I bed you I vas
ashleep, Tick."</p>

<p>"Blow me tight!" murmured Dick hazedly. "I feel
as though I'd had a nightmare myself. I never thought
it was in Matt to act like that, even if he <i>was</i> playing a
part. I hate to think hard things about my old raggie,
Motor Matt, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don'd!" cut in Carl. "Vait und gif him a chance to
oxblain. He vill come pack und tell us somet'ing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello, there, you fellows! Where have you been?"</p>

<p>As this familiar voice rang out, Carl and Dick whirled
in a panic. Motor Matt, in leather cap and jacket, trim
and neat as ever, was hastening toward them across the
levee.</p>

<p>Dick staggered and threw a hand to his head. Carl,
likewise, was at a loss for words. Here was Motor Matt,
running toward them across the levee, when, by rights,
he should have been a good way off in a carriage, getting
clear of a pot of trouble which he had set a-boiling.</p>

<p>The policeman, catching sight of Matt, rushed toward
him, the crowd at his heels. That brought Carl and Dick
to a full realization of what was going on.</p>

<p>"We made a bobble!" cried Dick.</p>

<p>"Yah, so helup me!" agreed Carl; "der vorst popple
vat iss. Und dot bolicemans iss some more."</p>

<p>The boys darted toward the officer and Matt.</p>

<p>"I've got you now, my lad," growled the officer, as the
boys came up. "You can't fool me by getting into another
outfit o' clothes. Your face is a dead giveaway."</p>

<p>Matt looked his surprise.</p>

<p>"You've made some mistake, officer," he answered.
"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he don't know a thing!" cried one of the bystanders
scoffingly.</p>

<p>"He's fergot all about burnin' that 'ar cotton bale,"
said another.</p>

<p>"A blame' quick change he made, anyhow," put in a
third.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Matt. "I just came
from Stuyvesant Dock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D'you mean to say you wasn't here a few minutes
ago, shufflin' around, smokin' a cigarette&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't smoke cigarettes," broke in Matt, "and I
wasn't here a few minutes ago. I've been with the air
ship, over on the dock, for the last hour."</p>

<p>"Ye was right here fer an hour," declared one of the
loungers. "I seen ye."</p>

<p>"I can easily disprove that," temporized Matt. "Go
and talk with the watchman on the dock, officer. He will
tell you that I have been with him for an hour."</p>

<p>The policeman, as well as the others, was in a quandary.
Matt's whole manner was different from that of
the youth whose cigarette had set fire to the cotton bale.
His talk was different, too, and there was nothing
"chesty" or insolent about him.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, pards?" asked Matt, appealing to
Carl and Dick. "I'm all at sea over this. When I got
to Stuyvesant Dock, an hour ago, the watchman there
told me that you boys had gone off somewhere on a
hurry-up call. I waited for you to come back, and then,
when I saw the smoke of the burning cotton bale, I
started for here."</p>

<p>"The trouble is deeper than I think any of us can
fathom," muttered Dick. "Strike me lucky, mate, but
there was a swab here who was the very picture of you&mdash;in
the face, mind, for his get-up was altogether different.
Carl and I was fooled, for we were dead sure the other
swab was you. That other fellow was smoking a cigarette,
and that's what set fire to the bale."</p>

<p>Dick faced the policeman.</p>

<p>"Hands off of him, officer," said he. "This isn't the
chap you want. He's Motor Matt&mdash;everybody up and
down the river front has heard of Motor Matt and his
chums, and of the air ship."</p>

<p>"I'm dashed if I can savvy this," murmured the perplexed
officer, "but I'm going to the Stuyvesant Dock
with you and see if the watchman will set me right. He's
a friend o' mine, the watchman is, and he'll give it to me
straight."</p>

<p>When Matt, Carl, Dick, and the officer started for the
Stuyvesant Dock, they left the crowd behind.</p>

<p>"I went over town, just at the beginning of the forenoon,"
said Matt, "and when I got back to the air ship
the watchman said that a man had come there and asked
for me. As I wasn't around, the watchman told me you
and Carl had answered the summons, Dick. Where did
you go?"</p>

<p>"The man who came was Cassidy, Townsend's mate on
the <i>Grampus</i>," answered Dick. "He said Townsend was
out on Prytania Street, and he gave me the number of
the house. Cassidy said the business was important, so
Carl and I got on a street car and went to the place.
Townsend is sick a-bed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sick?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Aye, and can't move. The trouble he had with Jurgens
and Whistler was the cause of it, Townsend thinks.
But we couldn't do the business for you&mdash;it's you, and
no one else, that Townsend wants. He gave us a letter
for you and wants you to call on him at midnight, to-night."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't tell us, but said he had explained that in
the letter."</p>

<p>"Where's the letter?"</p>

<p>There was a silence while the little group tramped
over the planks in the direction of Stuyvesant Dock.</p>

<p>"Oh, dowse me," muttered Dick. "I feel like thirty
cents!"</p>

<p>"I feel lesser as dot," chimed in Carl.</p>

<p>"What happened to the letter?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"You see, matey," explained Dick, very much crestfallen,
"when Carl and I saw that other fellow on the
levee, we were sure he was you."</p>

<p>"But he was dressed differently."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, that's true enough, but we thought you were
keeping tab on somebody and had put on those clothes in
order to do it."</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"You fellows must be locoed!" he exclaimed. "What
reason have I to go into the detective business?"</p>

<p>"Ve ditn't know dot," observed Carl, "but ve vas sure
dot odder feller vas you. Anyvay, Tick vistled ad him,
laidt der ledder on der cotton bale, und ven der feller
came for it, den, py shinks, his sigaroot sed der pale afire.
Aber he got der ledder, und some feller run avay mit him
in a puggy. Der boliceman hat tried to arresdt der feller,
aber he slipped glear. Ach, himmelblitzen, vat a pad
pitzness!"</p>

<p>"We didn't have a hap'orth o' sense," added Dick
gloomily.</p>

<p>By then the little party was close to the air ship. The
watchman was within hail, and a few words from him
satisfied the policeman.</p>

<p>"Sorry I bothered you, Motor Matt," apologized the
officer, "but you're a dead ringer for that other chap&mdash;which
is more credit to him than it is to you. He's your
double, all right, and I hope you get back your letter."</p>

<p>The policeman went one way, the watchman another,
and Matt led his chums to one side, where they could
have a little private talk by themselves.</p>

<p>His face was grave as he asked them to begin at the
beginning and give him all the facts, once more.</p>

<p>The ground was thrashed over pretty thoroughly, Matt
putting questions from time to time that brought out
even the apparently insignificant details. When the explanations
were done a silence fell over the chums. Dick
was first to speak.</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me," he observed, in deep contrition,
"neither Carl nor I seem able to do a thing right when
you're not around."</p>

<p>"I'm not finding any fault with you, pards," returned
Matt. "Even the officer was fooled, so it is quite natural
that you should have made the mistake. Give me that
number on Prytania Street. I'd better hike right out
there and have Townsend tell me what was in the letter."</p>

<p>"It would be a wrong move, mate."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Townsend said the matter was of the utmost importance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the more reason why I should find out about it
as soon as possible!"</p>

<p>"But he insisted that you wasn't to come to him until
midnight, to-night."</p>

<p>"He don't know the letter has got into wrong hands."</p>

<p>"Sure he don't, but he's afraid the house where he is is
being watched, and we were to tell you to come around
the back way and knock at the rear door. I'm a Fiji
if I know what's up, but Townsend was mighty particular
that you shouldn't come until midnight."</p>

<p>Matt was thoughtful for a space.</p>

<p>"They say that every one has a double," he remarked,
with a half laugh, "and it begins to look as though my
double had shown up. This double-trouble was something
I never expected to run into, but it's come and we'll
have to see it through. Townsend didn't give you a hint
as to what he wanted me for?"</p>

<p>"Never a hint," answered Dick. "He was mighty close
about it."</p>

<p>"Well," decided Matt, "I'll be at that house in Prytania
Street on the stroke of twelve, to-night. Let's feel
as easy as we can about that letter, and go and get some
supper."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TRICKED!</p>


<p>"What time is it, Cassidy?"</p>

<p>"A little after eleven, cap'n."</p>

<p>"Nearly an hour, then, before Motor Matt gets here."</p>

<p>"You told him not to come afore midnight, cap'n. I
didn't say anything ag'in it, although it struck me as how
that wasn't a very good time."</p>

<p>"I know my business, perhaps, better than you do,
Cassidy."</p>

<p>Townsend was a very sick man, and fretful. Apart
from his illness he had other things to worry him.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, cap'n," said Cassidy easily, "you know your
own business best."</p>

<p>"Was there a man across the street spying on the house
when you looked last?"</p>

<p>"I piped him off last when there was daylight enough
to see. He was there, all right, just as he has been for
the last two days."</p>

<p>"He must be there now, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Either him or somebody else. One man couldn't stay
on the job all the time, cap'n, you know. A feller has to
sleep an' eat."</p>

<p>"By having Motor Matt come at night, and come the
back way, the spy won't see him, will he?"</p>

<p>"I reckon not, cap'n. Even if Matt came the front
way, any time after eight o'clock, I don't think the spy
could tell him from Adam, across the street."</p>

<p>"My mind's made up. There's a load on me that I've
got to get rid of before I can be well."</p>

<p>"That's what frets me, cap'n," returned Cassidy earnestly.
"You're just sick enough to make a whole lot more
of that 'load' than you ought to. Quit worryin' about
it. That'll be better for the 'load' and for you, too."</p>

<p>"Does the landlady understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've told her to expect a friend of your'n by the back
door, an' Mrs. Thomas is sittin' up herself just to let the
friend in. She won't trust it to the servant girl."</p>

<p>"I'll remember Mrs. Thomas for that! When I'm well
again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A bell rang sharply in front of the house.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Townsend, starting up in
his bed.</p>

<p>"Don't get nervous, cap'n," answered Cassidy soothingly.
"It's only the gate bell. Some other visitor, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"I don't see why people have bells on their gates,"
worried Townsend. "I never saw it any other place."</p>

<p>A stir was heard in the regions below. Presently there
came the mellow tinkle of the doorbell, and the sound
of an opening door and voices. A little later a knock on
Townsend's door carried Cassidy to the entrance to the
room. Mrs. Thomas was in the hall.</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake," said the landlady in
her soft Southern drawl. "Mr. Townsend's friend came
to the front do', and I reckon he didn't know anything
about coming to the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Well, have him come up, Mrs. Thomas," called Townsend.
"I don't seem able to have anything as I want it.
Matt not only comes to the front door, but he comes
nearly an hour ahead of time. I'll see him, though. He's
a sharp boy, and if he's read my letter he'll know what I
expect of him."</p>

<p>The landlady went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to talk with Matt alone, Cassidy," continued
Townsend.</p>

<p>"I know that, cap'n," replied the mate, "and just as
soon as Matt gets in I'll slide out and leave you to yourselves."</p>

<p>Another rap fell on the door. Cassidy went to it and
admitted Joe Dashington, still in his old slouch hat,
sweater and corduroys.</p>

<p>"Great guns, Motor Matt!" exclaimed Cassidy, "I'd
hardly have known you in that get-up."</p>

<p>"Matt!" exclaimed Townsend querulously, lifting himself
on one elbow and staring at the caller. "Is that you,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"I guess I do look a Reub, eh?" laughed Dashington.
"Well, I thought I'd be foxy and get on a disguise. Hope
you're feeling better, Mr. Townsend?"</p>

<p>"You can go now," said Townsend, falling back on his
pillow.</p>

<p>The mate gave the caller a sharp sizing out of the clew
of his eyes and then went out, closing the door softly behind
him.</p>

<p>"Pull a chair up close to the bed, Matt," went on
Townsend. "I guess I'm getting better&mdash;the doctor says
so&mdash;but I'll know that as soon as these diamonds are off
my hands. I'm worried to death about them, as some one
has been watching this house for two days. Why didn't
you come the back way, as I told Carl and Dick to tell
you? And why didn't you wait until midnight?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Dashington, seating himself by the
bed, "the cars don't run so I could get here at just midnight,
old fel. I either had to come now, or get here
at half-past twelve. Thought I'd take an earlier chance.
As for coming the back way, I tried it; but there's no
alley and there's a dog in the next yard. I think this rig
I've put on'll fool anybody across the street, eh? And
then the talk that goes with it is some fine, don't you
think? I'm a regular lollypaloozer with the 'con' talk."</p>

<p>"You're about the most resourceful young fellow I've
ever come across," said Townsend, "and I knew you'd see
that everything was all right."</p>

<p>"Sure, old fel. I'm no hand to jolly, but I give you
credit for being a pretty slick piece of goods yourself.
But, say! Don't you think we'd better rush this business?
Ef there's a man piping the house off, the quicker
we finish and I duck, the better."</p>

<p>"Keen as ever, my boy!" exclaimed Townsend, in a
tone of relief. "Reach your hand under my pillow and
take out what you find there."</p>

<p>It was an eager hand that went under the pillow and
drew out a canvas bag.</p>

<p>"Those are the diamonds, Matt," said Townsend. "I
don't have to tell you anything about them. The address
of the lady to whom they are to go is on the card pinned
to the bag."</p>

<p>"Is she looking for me to come?" inquired Dashington.
"This isn't exactly a fashionable hour for a call."</p>

<p>"We'll have to overlook that point, Matt. The lady
will come to the door, and all you will have to say is
that the package is a valuable one and comes from the
Man from Cape Town. She will understand, although I
haven't been able to see her, or to send her word."</p>

<p>"Bank on me, old fel," answered Dashington, hardly
able to conceal the exultation he felt.</p>

<p>"Get a receipt from the lady, Matt."</p>

<p>"Sure. I always get a receipt when I deliver a valuable
package."</p>

<p>"And bring the receipt to me here, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That's me. Anything else, Townsend?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Matt, except to say that you're the only
person I'd trust to deliver those diamonds. Why, I
wouldn't even let Cassidy do the errand! I was to deliver
the stones personally, but it would be some time
before I could do that and I can't stand it any longer to
have such valuable property around me."</p>

<p>"I'm next to how you feel, all right, and I don't blame
you."</p>

<p>"Of course I could have sent Cassidy to the lady and
have had her come here, but that fellow across the street
might have seen her come, and if he's connected with the
people I think, then it's a dangerous gang who are laying
to get hold of those stones."</p>

<p>Dashington pushed the bag under his sweater and
got up.</p>

<p>"How much do you think these diamonds are worth?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"A fortune, a king's ransom!"</p>

<p>"Gee! There must be a double handful of the sparks
in the bag. Well, old fel, I'll be going. Hope you'll get
well in short order."</p>

<p>"I know I will, now," answered Townsend, with a deep
sigh of satisfaction. "I'll see you to-morrow, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Good night."</p>

<p>Dashington left the room and, as Cassidy came back,
the front door was heard to open and close.</p>

<p>"I never thought Matt King could get himself up to
look like that, cap'n," remarked the mate, as he took the
chair by Townsend's bed.</p>

<p>"He's a clever boy," averred Townsend, "and as steady
and reliable as a clock."</p>

<p>"He's about as different from what he usually is as
any one could imagine," pursued Cassidy. "The way he
acts and talks are both different. You're right, he's
clever."</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you now, Cassidy, something I've
been keeping from you," said Townsend, after a brief
pause. "You remember that iron chest that was hidden
away in an island in the Bahamas, and how a fellow calling
himself the Man from Cape Town gave me a chart
and asked me to go after the chest, bring it to New Orleans
and open it in the presence of a lady who lives in
St. Charles Avenue?"</p>

<p>"I know that by heart, cap'n," answered Cassidy.
"The lady who lives in St. Charles Avenue is the daughter
of the Man from Cape Town, and you was to open
the chest in her presence and divide the contents. Don't
talk about it. It's late, and you're tired and ought to go
to sleep."</p>

<p>"I'm not done, yet," demurred Townsend. "You know
how Jurgens and Whistler stole my submarine, the
<i>Grampus</i>, from Atlantic City, got the iron chest, and
how Motor Matt and his friends, in their air ship, recaptured
the submarine and found the iron chest aboard?"</p>

<p>"I was mixed up in that myself, so I don't reckon I'll
ever forget it."</p>

<p>"And then, when we came on here in the submarine,
you know how the chest was stolen by Jurgens, Whistler,
and Bangs; how Motor Matt recovered it; how Dick and
Carl let it slip through their hands; how it was opened
and found to contain the head of an African voodoo idol;
how the head was smashed and found to be full of South
African diamonds; how I did the worst thing I ever did
in my life and let Whistler, Jurgens, and Bangs go clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
when I could have had them sent to jail; and, lastly, you
know how suddenly this illness came upon me and prevented
me from taking the diamonds to the lady in St.
Charles Avenue, as I had planned."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

Find; or, The Secret of the Iron Chest."</p></div>

<p>"Yes, cap'n," said the mate, "I know all that."</p>

<p>"Well, here's something you don't know, Cassidy. I
have had those diamonds with me, here under my pillow,
all the time I've been sick."</p>

<p>"Great guns!"</p>

<p>"And," finished Townsend exultantly, "I have just
given them to Motor Matt to deliver to the woman.
When I am well, I will go to her and get my share of
them, as well as the share that is coming to Motor Matt
and his friends."</p>

<p>Cassidy was amazed. Before he could speak, however,
another rap fell on the door&mdash;a nervous and excited summons,
as could be told by the sound, alone.</p>

<p>"What now, I wonder?" fretted the sick man.</p>

<p>Cassidy opened the door and found Mrs. Thomas.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Cassidy," cried the landlady, "some one has
just come to the back door and he says he is Motor Matt&mdash;a
nice-looking, well-dressed young fellow who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" cried Townsend hoarsely, trying to get out
of bed.</p>

<p>"Softly, cap'n, softly!" warned Cassidy, leaping to the
bed and pushing Townsend back. "Mebby there's nothing
wrong. Anyhow, your cue is to take it easy. Tell
this other Motor Matt to come right up, Mrs. Thomas,"
he added.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT'S PROMISE.</p>


<p>Townsend had a bad two minutes waiting for Mrs.
Thomas to get downstairs and for Matt to come up. Finally,
when the young motorist entered the room, he was
astounded by what he saw.</p>

<p>Cassidy was half holding, half supporting Townsend
on the bed, and Townsend, his face like chalk and his
eyes staring glassily, was gazing at the newcomer.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" queried Matt. "What's wrong,
Cassidy?"</p>

<p>Cassidy shook his head. Before he could answer,
Townsend burst out:</p>

<p>"Were you here a few minutes ago, Matt? Did you
have on other clothes, and did I give you the diamonds?
For heaven's sake, tell me!"</p>

<p>"Easy, cap'n," warned Cassidy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Matt, instantly divining that something
had happened to the diamonds. "I was told not to come
until midnight, but I was anxious, and even now I am
ahead of time. Why?"</p>

<p>He approached the bed hurriedly, but Townsend had
sunk limply back, with a hollow groan.</p>

<p>"There was a fellow here who looked like you in the
face, Matt, and who said he was you. Townsend gave
him the bag of diamonds," said Cassidy.</p>

<p>Motor Matt reeled backward. He could think of but
two men, at that moment, and they were Jurgens and
Whistler. And he blamed himself. He should not have
listened to Carl and Dick, but should have posted at once
to Prytania Street and told Townsend how the letter
had been delivered to some one else through a mistake.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you tell that the fellow wasn't me, Cassidy?"
Matt demanded. "You had a close look at him.
He may have <i>looked</i> like me, but did he act, or talk, as I
do? Great spark plugs! In a case like that you ought
to have been more than sure."</p>

<p>"I didn't know the cap'n was going to hand the diamonds
over," returned Cassidy. "The cap'n only just
told me. I had my suspicions, but I couldn't just see how
the fellow would be here, accordin' to instructions, if he
wasn't you. And he sure looked like you, although his
talk and his actions were a trifle off. Oh, thunder, what
a go!"</p>

<p>"How was he dressed?" demanded Matt. "Quick&mdash;tell
me as much as you can about him."</p>

<p>"Slouch hat, gray sweater, dark corduroy trousers;
slangy, devil-may-care sort of chap. Not you, in that
way, by a jugful."</p>

<p>"And he left here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes ago."</p>

<p>Matt whirled and dashed from the room. At the foot
of the stairs he found the excited landlady.</p>

<p>"Have you a telephone in the house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"This way," answered Mrs. Thomas, appreciating the
fact that something important was urging Matt on and
that it was a time for action and not words.</p>

<p>The telephone was in the rear hall and Matt had soon
rung up the police department, given a description of
the youth, and of Jurgens, Whistler, and Bangs, and told
as much of what had happened as it was necessary for
the officers to know in order to make a quick and effective
search. In a few minutes he was back in Townsend's
room.</p>

<p>"The police," said Matt, "will get right to work; and
as soon as I am through talking here I will get to work
myself. Don't be discouraged, Mr. Townsend. That
young fellow may have got the diamonds, but he'll find
it hard to get away with them."</p>

<p>"I don't know," murmured Townsend, tossing his
hands, "but it seems to me as though everything connected
with that Man from Cape Town and his iron chest
is fated to make me trouble. Jurgens and Whistler must
be back of this!"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"But how did they know I was going to send the diamonds
to the woman in St. Charles Avenue to-night?
Where did they get hold of a young fellow who looks
so astonishingly like you to help them in their villainous
schemes?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you something about that, in a minute.
What did that fellow say when he came here?"</p>

<p>"He came in at the front gate, a little after eleven, and
he said he had disguised himself so that he could escape
the vigilance of possible spies. He also said that he had
come early, as the cars did not run, at this time of night,
so he could get here at sharp twelve. Oh, he had a clever
story! I'll warrant you that Jurgens fixed that part of
it for him."</p>

<p>"You wanted me to take the diamonds to the daughter
of the Man from Cape Town?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, didn't you know that?" demanded Townsend.
"Didn't you read my letter?"</p>

<p>"There's the point, Townsend. I did not see your letter.
If I had known what you wanted me to do, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
have come here early in the evening. But I didn't. All
I knew was that the work was important."</p>

<p>"But the letter, Matt, the letter! I told everything in
that. I did not care to trust the information with Carl
or Dick, or even with Cassidy. This house has been
watched for two days by some fellow who was skulking
on the other side of the street. I was afraid&mdash;the whole
thing had got on my nerves. The worst thing I ever
did," Townsend added in bitter self-reproach, "was to
let Jurgens, Whistler, and Bangs go when I had them
where the law could take care of them."</p>

<p>"This young fellow, who appears to be my double and
who has turned up so unfortunately in New Orleans,"
said Matt, "looks so much like me that he deceived even
Carl and Dick. While they were on the way back to the
dock, with your letter, they saw the fellow, and gave the
letter to him."</p>

<p>Townsend groaned despairingly.</p>

<p>"Never again," said he, "will I put such important matters
in black and white. But I thought I could trust Carl
and Dick to deliver the letter safely to you."</p>

<p>"You can hardly blame them for making the mistake,
Townsend," went on Matt, "when even you and Cassidy
were fooled."</p>

<p>"It's the most astonishing thing I ever heard of!" muttered
Townsend. "How two young fellows could look
so much alike, and how your double should happen
around at just the right time to play havoc with my carefully
worked-out plan. But it's fate. There's something
about those diamonds that brings ill luck. It seems to
have been destined, from the start, that they were never
to be delivered to this New Orleans woman."</p>

<p>"No matter what happens, Townsend," said Matt,
"your conscience is clear. The iron chest has caused you
expense, time and trouble, and you have tried faithfully
to do what this mysterious Man from Cape Town asked
of you. Don't take it so hard."</p>

<p>"I am culpable," declared Townsend, "in that I did not
put Jurgens and Whistler where they could never trouble
me again, that time I had it in my power. I am in duty
bound to get back those stones. I can't let those scoundrels
get away with them."</p>

<p>"Leave it to the police, cap'n," spoke up Cassidy.
"You're a sick man, and that's all you can do. Leave
it to the police, and the chances are that they will capture
the gang, for the trail is hot; but, if they don't capture
Jurgens, Whistler, and that young grafter and recover
the diamonds, it's just as Matt says; you haven't any
cause to feel cut up over it."</p>

<p>"But I <i>will</i> feel cut up over it," insisted Townsend,
with all the distorted reasoning of a sick man. "Matt, I
want you to promise me something. If you'll give the
promise, I'll feel fairly contented and will abide the result
with patience. Your promise, my boy, will help me
to get well."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I don't remember that you ever failed in anything you
have undertaken&mdash;and I've got the most of your history
ever since you left Arizona. What I want you to promise
is this, that you'll keep after Jurgens, Whistler and
that double of yours <i>until you recover the diamonds</i>."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The police won't be able to do it&mdash;I'm as sure of that
as I am that I am lying here in this bed this minute.
While everything connected with that iron chest and its
contents seemed to condemn me to a run of hard luck, it
has always been you and your good fortune that stepped
in, at the last minute, and saved the day. I am positive
that you can save the day now. There is that Obeah
woman, the voodoo priestess who aided you so strangely
and so well the other time. Go to her. She is a friend
of yours. Ask her to help you."</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must promise me, Matt!" insisted Townsend vehemently.
"I tell you I am to blame for the loss of the
diamonds, for I should have had Jurgens, Whistler, and
Bangs sent to jail when it was in my power to do so.
Will you promise?"</p>

<p>Cassidy gave Matt a significant look. It asked Matt,
for the sake of Townsend's comfort and health, to agree
to a task whose accomplishment would be difficult and
perhaps impossible.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Matt, quietly stepping to the bedside
and taking Townsend's hand in a firm pressure, "I
promise."</p>

<p>"That you will keep after the thieves until you finally
recover the diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I shall rest content," said Townsend. "Your
good luck, I know, will go with you. Go and find the
voodoo woman. Give me some medicine, Cassidy, for
I'm about played out."</p>

<p>Townsend sank back on his pillow and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Matt looked at him, at the haggard, careworn expression
on his face, at the gray hair sweeping his temples,
and, for the first time, realized what the difficulties and
perils connected with that mysterious iron chest had
meant to Archibald Townsend. As he turned softly
away and moved toward the door, his heart was steeled
with resolution to do his utmost&mdash;<i>and to win</i>!</p>

<p>He nodded to Cassidy, softly opened the door, and left
the room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DASHINGTON DASHED.</p>


<p>Joe Dashington was in fine feather as he left the house
with the bag of diamonds. A combination of circumstances
had enabled him to make a rich haul, and to make
it with an ease and celerity that surprised him.</p>

<p>He half expected that some one would overhaul him
and stop him before he got out of the house, but in this
he was happily disappointed. Reaching the sidewalk, he
passed through the gate and was confronted by Whistler.</p>

<p>Dashington had been told, whether successful or not
in getting the diamonds, to walk to the first cross street
south, where he would find Jurgens, Whistler, and Bangs
waiting for him. But the three men feared Dashington
might, if he managed to secure the diamonds, go north
instead of south, with the intention of keeping the
"sparks" for himself. For this reason, Whistler was sent
to meet him as he came out of the yard.</p>

<p>"Did you get 'em?" whispered Whistler.</p>

<p>"Did I?" exulted Dashington; "well, did I not! Oh, it
was a hot touch, but I got away with it with ground to
spare. I'm the fly boy, Whistler, and none of your common
dubs. But let's wabble right along. The sick Indian
has got a hefty gazabu for a right bower, and if the
right bower was played on us there'd be doings and we
might get queered."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hand me the bag, Dash," said Whistler, as they hurried
southward along the walk.</p>

<p>"Don't shove," answered Dashington. "It's tucked
away in my kimono and I'm so busy with the getaway
I don't want to cough up until we're with the rest of the
push. Honest, though, I'm no understudy for a low card,
am I?"</p>

<p>"You're the goods, Dash, and no mistake. Don't drop
that bag out of your sweater while we're hurrying."</p>

<p>"Nay, Frances, I couldn't be so absent-minded. When
I get my hooks onto a good thing I'm worse than the
Terrible Turk with a strangle hold."</p>

<p>"What did Townsend say?"</p>

<p>"He wanted me to come in at the rear; said some one
had been piping off the house from across the street.
Who was that?"</p>

<p>Whistler chuckled.</p>

<p>"Sometimes Bangs," he answered, "and sometimes a
fellow Bangs got to spell him."</p>

<p>"Then, Bangs and the other must have spelled it like
a couple of farmers. Townsend was wise."</p>

<p>"Motor Matt hadn't been there?"</p>

<p>"Not so you could notice."</p>

<p>"That was the point that worried me. If he had had
an idea what that letter contained, or that Jurgens and
I were mixed up with it, he'd have been with Townsend
hours ago, and the whole game would have been queered."</p>

<p>"And your Uncle Joe pinched. That gives me a good,
swift notion that I've taken some chances and ought to
have a pretty square look-in on the divvy. How much
do I pull down?"</p>

<p>"You'll pull down a-plenty, Dash."</p>

<p>"Put it in cold figures. You see, I don't like these
glittering generalities."</p>

<p>"We can't any of us tell how much we get till we see
how much there is."</p>

<p>"It ought to be ten thou, at least. Townsend said there
were enough sparks in the bag to make Tiffany's exhibit
look like a piker. Ten thou will buy me an interest in a
racing stable, and I'm dippy about the ponies. It's an
even-money break that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stow it! Here we are at the car."</p>

<p>At that moment, Whistler and Dashington came out
on the cross street. An automobile was drawn up at the
curb, and two men could be seen, one on the front seat
and one in the tonneau. The man behind proved to be
Bangs, and the man at the wheel was Jurgens. Both
were in their shirt sleeves, and Bangs' coat was lying over
the side of the car.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" gurgled Dashington, "so it's a benzine
buggy for ours, eh? It's a fancy pass and ought to
snatch us away before the police get busy."</p>

<p>"How did you make out, Dashington?" asked Jurgens,
in his anxiety getting up and leaning over the side of the
car.</p>

<p>"Easy money," answered the youth. "I had my brace
right with me, and the way I took that high jump calls
for a hand."</p>

<p>"You got the diamonds?"</p>

<p>"Ain't I telling you?"</p>

<p>"Take them, Whistler. Then both of you pile in and
we'll be going&mdash;and we'll have to go hard and fast, at
that."</p>

<p>Dashington dug the bag out from under his sweater.</p>

<p>"You're all jerry to this," said he, as he reached out
the bag to Whistler, "that I come in for a big bunch of
the dazzlers, and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's one of your dazzlers, my gay buck!"</p>

<p>Whistler, taking the bag in his left hand, struck out
with his right. Dashington, the breath jolted out of him,
staggered back.</p>

<p>"And there's another!"</p>

<p>Whistler struck again with all his savage strength.
This time Dashington dropped silently to his knees and
fell on his back, with his head over the curb.</p>

<p>"I reckon that will do him," laughed Jurgens. "Jump
in, Whistler. We'll be out of town before he gets back
his wits, and it's dollars to dimes he won't say a word to
the police."</p>

<p>Whistler laughed grimly as he pulled the crank and
then sprang into the automobile. In another moment the
machine had chugged away.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was five minutes before Dashington
groaned, opened his eyes and sat up. The stillness of
the night was all around him.</p>

<p>"Blanked!" he muttered, lifting both hands to his
aching head. "They knocked me a twister and got away
on the high speed. Oh, what a frost! It's a hot night,
but I'm a dub if I haven't got chilblains. Yes, little one,
you played the game like a farmer&mdash;the genuine, blown-in-the-bottle
Easy Mark. Dashed again. I ought to be
used to the double-cross by now, it's been dumped onto
me so many times. Ouch, my head! I'd like to pull off
the block and play football with it&mdash;that's about all it's
good for."</p>

<p>Dashington got up and leaned against a China ball tree.</p>

<p>"Feel like I'd been smoking some new brand of dope,"
he went on, waiting for the darkened landscape to stop
whirling and stay where it belonged. "This game of
graft don't pay," he went on moodily. "I'm always the
monk that pulls the hot nuts out of the fire for some
other strong-arm guy, and I'm getting weary on the job.
What funny noises a fellow hears after a jolt like that!"</p>

<p>Still leaning against the tree, Dashington began rubbing
his head.</p>

<p>"Why not cut out the crooked work and be decent?"
he mumbled thoughtfully. "I've trotted heats with dips,
second-story men, and sand-bag experts, and every last
one of 'em has blanked me when it came to the showdown.
Why not break away from the swift game and
take a job at five per, with three honest square meals and
a place to bunk? When you turn the X-rays on this
grafting game, there's nothing in it."</p>

<p>He left the tree and stepped from the curb to pick up
a dark object on the ground. He thought it was his hat,
but it turned out to be a coat.</p>

<p>"Am I daffy," he murmured, "or is this the coat I
saw swinging over the side of the chug-chug wagon?
It's the sack that belongs to neighbor Bangs, and if
there's a hundred or so in the pockets, I'm the boy to put
it where it will do the most good."</p>

<p>Picking up his hat, which lay a little distance from
where the coat had dropped, he hurried off toward the
nearest street lamp. Then, with deft fingers, he began
searching the coat pockets.</p>

<p>He found some cigars and a memorandum book; also
a short-barreled, loaded revolver. But there was no
money.</p>

<p>"That's the way luck handles me," he muttered angrily,
casting the coat aside. "Cigars never did agree with me,
and I've got as much use for the gun as I have for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
notebook. But, say! Maybe I can leave the pepper box
with some gent at the sign of the three balls."</p>

<p>He dropped the revolver into his pocket; then, quite
casually, he opened the memorandum book and began
turning the leaves. The street light was wavering and
none too good, but he drew closer to it and ran his eyes
over the pages.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he chanced upon something that
caused him to draw in a long breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, sister!" he exclaimed, drumming his knuckles delightedly
against his forehead. "If here ain't a chance to
even up with that sure-thing crowd, I'm a geezer. If
I can't go with them and take my share of the loot, I
can go against them and help separate them from the lot
of it. 'Bayou Yamousa!' That ought to be easily found.
Bayou Yamousa for mine, and I'm on the level from
this on. That's straight, and no stringin'. Bangs will
throw a fit when he finds out he's lost his coat, but it's
a lead pipe he won't come back for it."</p>

<p>Then, as Dashington dropped the memorandum book
into his pocket, he had another thought.</p>

<p>The police! For what he had done that night, even
though he had failed to benefit by it, there was a chance
of his getting caught and "doing time."</p>

<p>How long would it be before Motor Matt reached the
house in Prytania Street? And how long after that before
the law would be called in to do what it could toward
overhauling the thieves and recovering the diamonds?</p>

<p>"If I stand to win in this little game of one call three,"
he muttered, "I've got to duck good and hard. If
I'm pinched now, it means an easy getaway for Jurgens,
Whistler, and Bangs. But I'm not going to be
run in. I guess I'm keen enough to dodge the law while
hunting for Bayou Yamousa and giving those pinheads
a taste of their own dope. Me for the tall and uncut&mdash;and
here goes."</p>

<p>Dashington took a swift look around. There were as
yet no signs of threatening peril, but he knew danger
was close on him for all that. The river lay at one end
of the street, and as soon as he had got his bearings he
made for it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A HARD STARTER.</p>


<p>Hunting four thieves as shrewd as were Jurgens,
Whistler, Bangs, and the young fellow who had helped
them, looked like a tremendous order to Motor Matt.
And recovering the diamonds made the prospect seem
even more discouraging.</p>

<p>Matt, however, was on his mettle. He had given his
promise, perhaps rashly, to Townsend, and Townsend, as
well as every one else, knew that Motor Matt's word was
as good as his bond.</p>

<p><i>He had promised to recover the diamonds!</i></p>

<p>Townsend's mention of the Obeah woman had had not
a little to do with the promise.</p>

<p>The woman's name was Yamousa, and she lived in a
hut near a bayou of the same name. Matt knew the place
well, for he and his chums had stopped there, a few days
before, had been of some service to Yamousa, and had
been repaid by her in a way that had caused, and was
still causing, them any amount of wonder.</p>

<p>The voodoo priestess apparently possessed powers of
divination that were inexplicable. Her arts may have
been wholly trickery, but, if so, a wonderful chain of coincidences
had lent a cast of truth to her magic.</p>

<p>Matt had no belief in the supernatural, and his common
sense was constantly struggling against the results
of Yamousa's occult powers, as he and his friends had
witnessed them. As a last resort, it might be possible to
consult Yamousa with some show of success in this matter
of the stolen gems.</p>

<p>This, at least, was what Matt had in mind when he
left Townsend. The authorities, knowing the ins and
outs of the Crescent City so well, could do infinitely more
in the town than could Matt and his friends.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, Matt returned to the small hotel
near Stuyvesant Dock, where he, Dick, and Carl had
taken up their quarters. Dick and Carl were in their
room, dressed and waiting to hear what Matt had to say.</p>

<p>Quickly as he could, the young motorist set forth the
amazing events of the night. The sailor and the Dutch
boy were greatly wrought up.</p>

<p>"Carl and I are loaded to the marks with all the blame,"
scowled Dick.</p>

<p>"Ve made some popples," wailed Carl, "und dey vas
vat dit der pitzness."</p>

<p>"What's the use of doubles, anyhow?" went on Dick.</p>

<p>"Vyefer do two people look so mooch alike in dis
vorlt?" added Carl. "I vonder oof I haf a touple? Oof
I haf, he must be a bicture, aber I hope he don'd shove
indo anyt'ing vat habbens mit me."</p>

<p>"You boys made only a natural mistake," said Matt.
"That levee policeman was fooled, Cassidy was deceived,
and so was Townsend. How can you blame yourselves
when every one else took this double of mine just as you
did?"</p>

<p>"You've got a way, mate," observed Dick gratefully,
"of tacking about and trimming your sails to any breeze
that blows in order to make things easier for your friends;
but Carl and I know that we're responsible for the whole
blessed business."</p>

<p>"Well, if you're bound to have it so, let it go at that.
I've promised Townsend to hunt the thieves until I recover
the diamonds. That means the work of our lives,
for it's a promise I intend to live up to."</p>

<p>"Py shinks," cried Carl, "you can gount on me to do all
vat I can to helup."</p>

<p>"Aye, old ship," said Dick, "and me. Just show us
where to begin and we'll tear into the work like a couple
of navvies. It's the best we can do to square ourselves."</p>

<p>"Led us dry und be as jeerful as ve can," suggested
Carl. "Dot iss pedder dan to be gloomed oop so mooch,
hey?"</p>

<p>"You've raised the point that bothers me, Dick," said
Matt, "and that is, where to begin. The police are already
at work in New Orleans, but I haven't any idea
that they'll be successful. We're dealing with clever men,
and mustn't forget that for a minute. Ever since the
diamonds were found, Jurgens and Whistler seem to have
been watching Townsend. They had a spy across the
street keeping an eye on the house where he is lying ill."</p>

<p>"Townsend missed it by not having that outfit jugged
when he was able. If every man jack of them had been
sent to the brig, we wouldn't be up against this proposition
now."</p>

<p>"No use crying over spilt milk," returned Matt.
"Townsend realizes that he failed to do what he should
have done, and it's that that worries him now. We'll take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
things as we find them and forge ahead. There's one
point we can look up, although it isn't very promising."</p>

<p>"Name it, mate."</p>

<p>"My double was taken from the levee in a carriage. It
may have been one of Jurgens' gang who helped him out
of his trouble."</p>

<p>"The fellow didn't look like any of the gang."</p>

<p>"There may be some new members we don't know anything
about. If we can find the man who drove the carriage,
we could discover where he took that young
fellow."</p>

<p>"What good would that do? Jurgens and his outfit
wouldn't come back to that place. I'll lay a sov the lot
of them tripped anchor and bore away the minute the
stones came into their hands."</p>

<p>"That's my idea, Dick. I told you the clue wasn't very
promising, but it appears to be the only one we have.
Townsend, however, suggested something which had also
occurred to me."</p>

<p>"Vat it iss?" queried Carl. "I don'd vas mooch oof
a handt to dig oop clues, aber I bed you I can tell a goot
clue ven I come face to face mit it. Shpeak it oudt,
Matt."</p>

<p>"Why not bear away in the air ship to Bayou Yamousa?"</p>

<p>Carl began to shiver.</p>

<p>"Nod dere! Ach, py shinks, don'd have somet'ing to
do mit dot olt shpook laty again."</p>

<p>Carl's superstitious fears did not weigh very heavily
with Matt and Dick. The latter slapped his hands.</p>

<p>"First chop!" he cried. "It's the last shot in the locker,
and who knows but that it may be just the thing for us
to do? I'm for beginning the trip to Bayou Yamousa
now. It's a still night, mates, and we could get the <i>Hawk</i>
off the dock without any trouble. She's ripe and ready
for the flight of her life!"</p>

<p>"It's a still night, that's true, Dick," answered Matt,
"but you forget that we have got to have daylight for
finding the bayou. We can't locate it in the dark."</p>

<p>"But we're losing time," grumbled Dick, "and we
haven't any to throw at the birds."</p>

<p>"The more haste, the less speed," counseled Matt.
"Better to go slow and be sure of what we're doing,
Dick, than to run wild and get tangled up in our bearings.
We'd probably lose more time in the end if we did that."</p>

<p>"But Jurgens and his gang are getting farther and
farther away all the time."</p>

<p>"They'll go into hiding somewhere, if I'm any prophet,
until the affair blows over a little. If Yamousa can tell
us where they are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don'd try dot," put in Carl earnestly. "She vill vork
a hogus-pogus und meppy ged all oof us indo drouple."</p>

<p>"We're going to pay Yamousa a visit, Carl," said Matt
firmly. "There's nothing else we can do. The police will
be able to handle this end of the work much better than
we could. Go to bed, both of you. I'm going over to
police headquarters and tell the chief about the carriage
that took the man and the young fellow away from the
levee. As soon as I do that, I'll come back and pull
covers myself. In the morning we'll have breakfast, and
then we'll make a start for the bayou."</p>

<p>As usual, Matt's ideas prevailed. Dick and Carl went
to bed, Matt had a talk with the city authorities and
gave as much further information as he thought would
help them, and then returned to the hotel and turned in.</p>

<p>By seven in the morning they were up and eating their
breakfast. Breakfast over, Matt sent Carl to the post
office for any mail that might be there&mdash;he was constantly
receiving letters from various parts of the country
relative to the <i>Hawk</i>&mdash;and he and Dick started for
Stuyvesant Dock to make ready for the flight south and
east.</p>

<p>On the way to the dock, Matt bought a morning paper.
There was a brief and garbled account of the robbery,
but it had little interest for the boys, although they had
bought the paper in order to see what it had to say about
the diamonds.</p>

<p>But there was a paragraph of overwhelming interest to
the lads tucked away in one corner of the first page.
Matt's eye caught the paragraph casually, then he gasped
and his consternation grew, as he read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"NOTED VOODOO WOMAN DEAD.</p>

<p>"From Chef Menteur, in the Parish of Orleans, comes
news of the death of a famous character in those parts
known as Yamousa, priestess of the voodoos. Years
ago she lived in New Orleans, numbering her followers
by hundreds, but was driven away by the police and
found refuge on Bayou Yamousa. Those with any faith
in the black arts credited the aged negress with being an
adept in her particular line, but others with more common
sense and less superstition considered her a grafter of
remarkable ability. Her death, it is supposed, was the
result of natural causes."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here was a blow, and no mistake. Matt, greatly dejected,
read the paragraph to Dick.</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me!" exclaimed Dick. "We're up in the
air now for fair. Your luck seems to have taken a turn
for the worse, Matt. What are we going to do? The
last prop has been knocked out from under us."</p>

<p>The boys reached the dock and seated themselves
moodily on a cotton bale not far from the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>Matt had not the remotest idea what they were to do.
Yamousa had been their last hope, and a strange fatality
had suddenly snatched it away from them.</p>

<p>"The outlook is getting more and more dubious," said
Matt. "Yamousa might not have been able to help us,
but there was a chance that she could. Now the chance,
slim enough at best, is gone. It's a lucky thing, though,
that I bought the paper and found that notice. If I
hadn't, we might have been wasting time, off in the southeast.
If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ledders! ledders. Dree oof dem!"</p>

<p>Carl, at that moment, came ambling across the dock,
dodging the boxes and bales and hurrying toward Matt
and Dick. As he approached he held up the three letters
he had secured at the post office.</p>

<p>They were all for Motor Matt, two of them having
been forwarded from Atlantic City. One was from an
amusement manager in Chicago, offering a fancy figure
to the boys to take the <i>Hawk</i> to the great lakes for exhibition
purposes; another was from an enthusiastic member
of the Aëro Club of America asking the boys their
price for the air ship; but the third letter&mdash;that was the
one that caused them to sit up and take notice. It ran as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From what I've heard of you, you're a one-two-seven
boy and all to the good. How'd you like to get your
lunch hooks on that bag of sparks? You can pull it off,
if you get busy, and the undersigned will help. All you
need is nerve and ginger. I can furnish my share.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
You've got an air ship. Well, hit the clouds and fly to
me. I'll put you wise. Meet me at Bayou Yamousa,
wherever that is, and come in a hurry. I'm going there
now and I've got the start of you by some hours. This
is a hot starter, and no 'con.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BULLET FROM BELOW.</p>


<p>The boys were stunned. Could it be possible that this
was a "straight tip," and not a hoax?</p>

<p>The letter was written on a scrap of paper taken from
a notebook; and the envelope in which it was inclosed
had been used twice. The first time it had been addressed
to "Hubert Bangs, General Delivery, New Orleans, La."
The "Hubert Bangs" had been scratched off with a lead
pencil and Motor Matt's name written in its place. The
ragged end of the envelope had been folded over and secured
with a pin.</p>

<p>"A drick!" muttered Carl. "Dot feller Pangs iss vone
oof Jurgens' gang."</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky," put in Dick, "but that's the sizing
I give it, Matt."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," averred Matt. "If a trick was intended,
Bangs would never have used an old envelope
bearing his name. Be sure of that. Even if a trick <i>was</i>
intended, it would be a ruse to get us into the vicinity of
the gang of thieves. The gang wouldn't do that, being
too anxious, just now, to keep out of sight. But, supposing
that was Jurgens' game, wouldn't it be a good
thing for us to come close to the thieves? They have
the diamonds, and they are what we want."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" exclaimed Dick. "Hoax or no, our move
is to slant away for Bayou Yamousa, where we intended
to go in the first place. We'll not find Yamousa there,
but luck of another kind may be waiting for us."</p>

<p>"Vy von't ve findt Yamousa?" inquired Carl, his face
brightening a little.</p>

<p>Dick showed him the paragraph in the paper and Carl
spelled it out, his face continuing to clear as he read.</p>

<p>"I don'd vish der olt foodoo voman any hardt luck,"
breathed Carl, "aber I vas gladder she ain'd dere as dot
she vas. It vill be pedder for us. Are ve going to hit
der air route?"</p>

<p>"Just as quick as we can," answered Matt briskly, hurrying
to the car.</p>

<p>There was no wind to speak of, but it required man&oelig;uvring
to guide the <i>Hawk</i> out from under the high
roof and to the edge of the dock. The boys, after stowing
the mooring ropes by which they had hauled the air
ship into the open, got aboard the car and Matt started
the engine.</p>

<p>A moment later the propeller took the push, and the
<i>Hawk</i> glided up her airy path until she swung high over
the City of New Orleans. People below could be seen
running about and looking and pointing upward.</p>

<p>"We're causing quite a stir, mates," remarked Dick.
"We'd cause more of a stir, though, if those people down
there knew what we had in our noodles."</p>

<p>Carl ran out the American flag to the rear end of the
air ship, and waved his cap. A cheer arose, weirdly distinct
and inspiring.</p>

<p>"I feel in my pones," said Carl, "dot somet'ing iss
going to habben. It's der olt hunch come pack. I hafen't
felt dot for some leedle time. Aber I'd like to know," the
Dutch boy added, as he floundered back to his post forward,
"who it vas sent dot ledder."</p>

<p>"One of the gang may have weakened, or have been
left out in the division of the booty," said Matt, laying
his course calmly, and feeling very much at home and
contented, now that he was running his beloved motor
again. "The house in Prytania Street, you know, was
watched night and day. It was spied upon yesterday
afternoon and night while Jurgens, Whistler, and Bangs
must have been laying their plans. It's my idea that there
is another member of the gang, and perhaps it is this
fourth man who wrote the letter."</p>

<p>"One guess is as good as another, mate," replied Dick.
"We'll know who the fellow is, maybe, when we get to
the bayou."</p>

<p>"Und meppy nod," said Carl. "Meppy dose fellers haf
a drap all sed for us, und dot ve vill trop indo it und
mix oop mit all kindts oof oxcidement."</p>

<p>"That's right, Carl," growled Dick. "You're the original
wet blanket. Why don't you square away and look
on the bright side? The job that's set for us is hard
enough without any of your croaking."</p>

<p>"I don'd vas croaking!" protested Carl. "I look on
der plack site, und den, ven der pright site shows oop ve
like him pedder pecause ve don't oxbect it. I am jeerful
all der dime. Ask Matt aboudt dot."</p>

<p>"Carl's intentions are good, Dick," said Matt. "You
must give him credit for that. We both know the prospect
ahead of us isn't any too pleasing. We're going it
blind and trusting to luck. The more I think about that
letter, however, the more confidence I have in the good
intentions of the writer. Whistler, you know, used to
work on a plantation near Bayou Yamousa. It's easy
to suppose that he has a knowledge of the country in that
section, and that knowledge will stand the gang in hand,
now that they're looking for a place to lay low."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," agreed Dick. "We'll get alongside
those duffing beach combers, and then it will be up to us
to lay them aboard and grab the diamonds. We'll do
it," he added stoutly. "Motor Matt's along, and Motor
Matt's luck is with us."</p>

<p>Light as the bird after which she was named, the
<i>Hawk</i> skimmed through the sunlit air, five hundred feet
above the "Father of Waters." Boats below, bound for
New Orleans or outward to the Gulf, were passed, many
a glass being trained on the air ship and its passengers.</p>

<p>Matt and his chums had gone over this route once before,
and now, while they were taking the back track,
they remembered the landmarks and guided the <i>Hawk</i>
accordingly.</p>

<p>After two hours of sailing over the river, Dick sighted
their turning point and gave the order for an easterly
course. The <i>Hawk</i> swung around, answering the steering
rudder easily. The motor worked perfectly, and the
air ship swerved and shifted with the slightest touch on
the guiding lever.</p>

<p>"And that swab who belongs to the Aëro Club wants
to buy the <i>Hawk</i>!" scoffed Dick. "We'll never sell her,
Matt. If it's money we want, we can make more with
the air ship than we could in any other line of business.
Besides, who'd change this air flying for anything else
under heaven? I'd flog the cat all the days of my life
if we were ever foolish enough to let go of this craft."</p>

<p>"I'll go on record in the same way, Dick," said Matt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me, too," chanted Carl. "Vile ve haf der <i>Hawk</i> ve
can be vay oop in G, all der time. Yah, you bed my life,
I like dis pedder as anyt'ing."</p>

<p>That flight was the very poetry of the lads' air-ship
experience. Fate was lowering over the <i>Hawk</i>&mdash;destruction
was skulking just ahead in the heavy timber below&mdash;and
Motor Matt and his chums were to look back on that
flight to Bayou Yamousa as their last.</p>

<p>Mile after mile of tree tops sped rearward under the
car. The boys knew that they were drawing close to the
bayou, and Carl and Dick were attending strictly to their
work as lookouts.</p>

<p>"I t'ink I see der rifer vat der bayou iss on," announced
Carl suddenly, pointing ahead and a little to the left.
"Vat you t'ink, Tick? Vas I righdt?"</p>

<p>"Come down a little, Matt," called Dick; "I think I'm
beginning to recognize this country, and that Carl has
called the turn."</p>

<p>Matt tilted the rudder and the <i>Hawk</i> swooped downward.
Before Matt brought the air ship to a level, they
were less than twenty feet above the tops of the tallest
trees.</p>

<p>"Two points to port, mate," shouted Dick. "There,"
he added, "hold her so. Very well done. We're coming
to the bayou, cap'n and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick's words were bitten short by a sharp, incisive
note from below. This was followed instantly by a smashing
sound, a spiteful <i>slap</i>, and a wild hissing.</p>

<p>Cries of alarm came from Dick and Carl.</p>

<p>The motor stopped with an impotent gurgle, the propeller
slowed down, and the <i>Hawk</i> began to pitch forward
and backward and to swerve sideways dangerously.</p>

<p>"Some one shot at us!" yelled Dick excitedly. "The
bullet came from among the trees, down there!"</p>

<p>"Py shinks," roared Carl, in a panic, "ve're done for.
Ged her down on der groundt, Matt! Be as kevick as
vat you can! Ach, himmeblitzen, I bed you ve vas all
goners."</p>

<p>"Steady, pards!" came the calm, unruffled voice of
Motor Matt. "Hang on! Don't jump or let yourselves
be thrown out. There's plenty of gas in the bag yet and
it may be I can find a landing. Do you see an opening
anywhere among the trees, Dick? Look sharp and speak
quick!"</p>

<p>"I can't see the first sign of a clearing," Dick answered.</p>

<p>Just then the <i>Hawk</i> went into the wildest contortions.
She seemed like a living thing, wounded to the death
and plunging about in fierce agony.</p>

<p>First the car would be tilted until it was almost perpendicular
in the air; then it would swerve to the same
position, with the other end of the car downward; and,
all the time it was leaping upward and downward in this
hair-raising way, it was jerking violently right and left.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the boys to do anything more
than to hang on for their lives. Occasionally they were
swinging out of the car, above the tree tops, and again
they would be hurled fiercely against the iron framework.</p>

<p>Matt, in this desperate plight, continued to keep his
head. He knew that the bullet fired from below had
struck and damaged the motor, and had then passed on
through the gas bag.</p>

<p>The gas was pouring out, but Matt was hoping that
enough buoyancy would remain to give them a safe landing
on the surface, even if it must be a rough one.</p>

<p>In this he was disappointed. Suddenly there came a
tearing sound from the bag, and all in the car knew that
the bullet hole had widened into a rent under pressure
of the gas.</p>

<p>Then, like so much lead, the doomed air ship swooped
downward and crashed into the top of a tree.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WRECK.</p>


<p>For a moment, after the crash, Motor Matt was
stunned and bewildered. When he regained his senses
completely and realized where he was, he found that he
was wedged between the guard rail of the car and a
branch of the tree. Turning his head, he looked downward
through a clear depth of fifty feet. But for the
guard rail, he would have dropped the entire distance and
probably have lost his life.</p>

<p>"Carl!" he shouted, clinging to the limb.</p>

<p>"Here I vas, Matt!" came the stifled answer. "I vas
hung oudt on a pranch like der veek's vash. Ach, du
lieber, vat a luck! Der poor <i>Hawk</i>, she iss gone oop der
shpout."</p>

<p>"Let's be thankful we didn't go up the spout along
with her," replied Matt. "Where's Dick?"</p>

<p>"I don'd know vere he iss. Iss he on der groundt?
Himmelblitzen! Oof anyt'ing has habbened mit
Tick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dick?" shouted Matt. "I say, Dick!"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and a sickening sensation sped
along the young motorist's nerves.</p>

<p>Turning again, he stared with frenzied eyes toward the
ground near the tree. With an exclamation of thankfulness,
he saw nothing there to justify his worst fears.</p>

<p>The tree was a live oak and thickly covered with
Spanish moss. Dick could very easily be somewhere in
the tree and yet out of sight. Certainly, although unconscious
and not able to answer, he must have been
caught and held among the branches.</p>

<p>"Is your position a safe one, Carl?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Veil, oof I don't hang on mit bot' handts und my
eye vinkers I vill be on der groundt in some heaps."</p>

<p>"Hang on, then, and stay right where you are. I'm
going to look for Dick."</p>

<p>One of the mooring ropes was close to Matt. Carefully
he took his knife from his pocket and severed the
rope; then, making one end fast to the tree limb, he
clung to it while he got out from under the iron guard
rail. Presently he was able to stand upright on the limb
and peer about him through the trailing streamers of
moss. He could not see Dick, but he did see something
that impressed him powerfully. The <i>Hawk</i>, in one brief
minute, had been relegated from the ranks of successful
air ships into a mere mass of junk, wedged into the
branches of the oak.</p>

<p>The gas bag was almost entirely deflated and looped
itself over the bent and broken limbs. The silken envelope
was hopelessly torn and much of it in rags.</p>

<p>The motor had been demolished, the end of the car
containing it having come in smashing contact with a big
limb. Besides that the ironwork was twisted and parts
of it had snapped off.</p>

<p>There could be no repairing the air ship. She was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
much a total loss as though she had gone to the bottom
of the sea in fathomless waters.</p>

<p>Matt's heart felt a sudden wrench; but he thrust aside
the feeling and continued his search for Dick. Carefully
he made his way along the limb toward the silken envelope,
pushing away the moss and peering anxiously as he
went.</p>

<p>"Don'd you see nodding?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"I can see that we'll never again do any sailing in the
<i>Hawk</i>," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Ach, dot makes me feel pad mit meinseluf!" wailed
Carl. "But I vas glad I vas alife! It vas some tight
skveaks, I bed you. Tick!" he yelled. "Vere you vas,
Tick?"</p>

<p>Still there came no answer. Silence reigned everywhere
in the thick timber and Carl's voice echoed weirdly
among the trees.</p>

<p>"He must be hurt and unable to answer, Carl," said
Matt.</p>

<p>"You vas looking, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Vell, don'd fall off mit yourseluf, dot's all. I don'd
vas goot for anyt'ing, my nerfs iss in sooch a frazzle.
All I can do is to hang on und say my brayers forvarts,
packvarts, und sitevays. Oof ve could only find Tick
I vould veel pedder."</p>

<p>Matt finally reached the remains of the gas bag.
Climbing upward, he pushed the outer folds aside and
there, lodged in the fork of a limb, was Dick.</p>

<p>Dick lay across the fork, head and hands hanging
downward. His cap was caught in some small branches
below.</p>

<p>"Here he is, Carl!" shouted Matt.</p>

<p>"Yah," answered the Dutch boy, "now I see him since
you haf pulled der pag avay. He iss on der same limb
as me. Do&mdash;do you t'ink he vas deadt, Matt?"</p>

<p>"He may be only stunned," replied Matt. "The thing
to do is to get him out of there before he comes to and
makes a move that will send him downward in a rush.
See any rope near you, Carl?"</p>

<p>"Dere iss a coil oof it righdt py me. Vait und I vill
ged it."</p>

<p>Matt heard Carl moving about cautiously, and finally
the end of a rope came toward him. Matt caught the
rope, but came within an inch of falling as he did so.</p>

<p>"I've got it, Carl," said he. "You keep hold of the
other end and come forward along the limb. It will take
both of us to get Dick down safely."</p>

<p>Carl, on hands and knees, came slowly along the limb.
While he was advancing, Matt reached up and tied the
end of the rope securely about Ferral's body, under the
arms. By that time, Carl was close to Ferral, standing
on the limb and hanging to a branch.</p>

<p>"There's a good big crotch of the tree below me,"
called Matt, "and if you can lower Dick down, I'll drop
lower where I can work better."</p>

<p>"I vill do der pest vat I can, Matt," answered Carl.
"Tick has der rope aroundt him, und ve can keep him
from falling. Go on mit yourseluf."</p>

<p>"You'd better tie your end of the rope around the
limb," counseled Matt, "and I'll take a turn of it around
this broken branch. That will give me a leverage when
we come to lower Dick."</p>

<p>While Carl secured the end of the rope, Matt slid
down into the large fork.</p>

<p>"All ready!" he called up. "Be careful now, Carl.
The least slip will send both you and Dick downward."</p>

<p>"I do der pest vat I can," repeated Carl.</p>

<p>Bracing himself in the fork, Matt held to the rope
with one hand and reached up the other as Dick came
down to him.</p>

<p>The rope tightened around the stump of the branch,
and Matt let it slide through his hand.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully Motor Matt went about his work,
watched breathlessly by Carl.</p>

<p>The purchase Matt had on the rope was sufficient
to enable him to hold Dick in the air while he guided
his swaying body downward. As soon as Dick was below
him, Matt was able to lay hold of the rope with both
hands and let Dick drop at a swifter rate.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Dick was safely on the ground, an
inanimate heap at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>"Dot vas vell done!" declared Carl, heaving a long
sigh of relief. "Now how ve going to ged down ourselufs,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"Have you tied the rope securely, up there?"</p>

<p>"Yah, so."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to slide down. You go first, Carl.
As soon as you reach the ground, I'll follow you."</p>

<p>"I don'd vas mooch oof a sailor," said Carl, sitting
down on the limb and laying hold of the rope, "und I
can shlide down a lod easier as I couldt climb oop. Here
I go!"</p>

<p>The first twenty feet of the rope was covered by Carl
like chain lightning; after that, however, he got a better
grip and went the rest of the way more slowly.</p>

<p>Matt lowered himself hand over hand, descending as
easily as though he was going down a ladder. Carl
was kneeling beside Dick when Matt's feet touched
ground.</p>

<p>"His heart iss going like anyt'ing," observed Carl joyfully,
"und I can't findt dot he has any proken pones."</p>

<p>"We'll carry him to the edge of the bayou and see if
a little water won't help revive him," said Matt. "Poor
old Dick! He'll take the loss of the <i>Hawk</i> pretty hard,
but we ought all of us to be thankful we got out of that
scrape with our lives."</p>

<p>"It vas der closest call vat efer I hat, you bed you!
Aber say, vonce!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Ve vas forgedding aboudt der feller vat fired dot
pullet. Oof he vas anyvere aroundt, meppy he vill haf
some more pullets for us."</p>

<p>The wreck, and the saving of Dick, had so taken up
Matt's attention that he had not given any thought to
the marksman who had caused the trouble.</p>

<p>As Carl spoke, both boys lifted themselves erect and
peered about them. They could see no one.</p>

<p>"The scoundrel is leaving us alone," said Matt darkly.
"He ought to be content with what he has done, I think,"
and he swept a rueful glance upward into the tree.</p>

<p>"Who he vas, do you t'ink?"</p>

<p>"Some hunter, perhaps; maybe it was a superstitious
negro, who fired at us and then ran away."</p>

<p>"Und meppy," suggested Carl, in a tremor, "it vas
some oof der Jurgens gang! Meppy dot iss der drap
dey vas going to shpring."</p>

<p>"Maybe; but, even if what you say is correct, we've
got to go right ahead and take care of Dick. Lay hold
of him, Carl, and help me."</p>

<p>The two boys picked up their injured chum and carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
him to the bank of the bayou; then, while Matt made
a more extensive examination, in order to determine the
seriousness of Dick's injury, Carl went after water.</p>

<p>There was a bad bruise on Dick's forehead, but it was
no more than a bruise, although it must have been caused
by a pretty hard blow.</p>

<p>"As he went over the limb, Carl," said Matt, "he must
have struck his head against it. I don't think he is badly
hurt, though."</p>

<p>Taking Carl's cap, which the Dutch boy had filled with
water, Matt dashed the contents in Dick's face. While
Carl was going back after more water, Dick suddenly
opened his eyes and stared at Matt.</p>

<p>"How's everything, mate?" murmured Dick.</p>

<p>"We're alive, old chap," replied Matt, "and that ought
to be enough, don't you think, considering what we've
been through?"</p>

<p>"You and Carl are all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I dodged Davy Jones, after shaking hands with
him?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way."</p>

<p>"Then, strike me lucky! it's better than I had hoped
for."</p>

<p>Just then Carl came running up the bank and grabbed
Dick's hand.</p>

<p>"I hat radder be porn lucky as hantsome, any tay," he
rejoiced, "hey, Tick?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE UNEXPECTED.</p>


<p>Ferral staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"It's a regular monkey's fist to me," said he, "how we
ever got out of that mess. The last I remember I was
slamming into the branches of a tree, then something hit
me and the sunshine was turned off. It can't be, mates,
that I dropped clear through that tree and hit the ground?
I'm tough, but I think I'd show more marks than I do
if that had happened."</p>

<p>Matt explained how Dick had been got down out of
the wreck of the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>"You lads must have had a rummy old time of it, hauling
me around that tree top," went on Dick. "And so
the good old <i>Hawk</i> is done for! She carried us many a
mile, mates, and we'll never see her like again unless&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused.</p>

<p>"Unless what?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, unless we can get her out of the tree and patch
her up."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Dick. That would cost more than it
would to build a new air ship. If we thought it worth
while to do that, I have some new ideas I'd like to incorporate
into the machine."</p>

<p>Dick's heaviness vanished a little.</p>

<p>"We've money enough in the bank, Matt," said he,
"and if you say the word, we'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'd better get out of the trouble this air ship has
got us into, Dick," interrupted Matt, "before we think
of building another."</p>

<p>"That's so. We look like a lot of ragamuffins. I'd
like to clap eyes on that loafing longshore scuttler that
brought us down! Can you make a guess as to who it
was?"</p>

<p>"It might have been some superstitious negro hunter;
or, as Carl suggested, Jurgens or one of his gang. If
it was any of the latter, we have probably fallen into a
snare. But if it was one of the robbers, why don't he
show himself?"</p>

<p>"That may not be his game. What's our next move,
Matt? We can't stand here boxing the compass when
there's dirty weather ahead."</p>

<p>"I'm expecting the writer of that letter to put in an
appearance. From what he wrote, I thought he would
be here ahead of us."</p>

<p>"I tell you somet'ing!" exploded Carl. "He vas der
feller mit der gun. He got us here und he bagged us,
und now he don'd vant to come oudt vere ve can ged a
look at him. I vould like to knock his plock off, yah, so
helup me!"</p>

<p>"We might make a move in the direction of Yamousa's
cabin," said Matt. "That would be a more comfortable
place to wait than out here in the open."</p>

<p>"Don'd you nefer t'ink dot!" chattered Carl. "Der
blace iss pad meticine. I bed you der olt foodoo's shpook
haunts der capin."</p>

<p>"Avast, there, you flying Dutchman!" reproved Dick.
"We don't believe in spooks. If you're afraid to go with
us, Carl, you can heave to and drop your anchor right
here."</p>

<p>"I go verefer you go, und dry und be as jeerful as bossiple,
only I don'd like going to der shpook laty's house."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick set out around the edge of the bayou
and were presently upon familiar ground. Dick indicated
the spot where the <i>Hawk</i> had been moored, upon
the occasion of their first visit to the place, and it was
there that Matt called a halt while they made a survey
of the hovel where the Obeah woman had lived.</p>

<p>It had been decorated with bones of various kinds,
when the chums saw the place first, but now the bones
had disappeared. The door was closed, but there was a
bucket standing beside the doorstep.</p>

<p>"From the looks," said Matt, "I should say that there
is some one in the hut."</p>

<p>"Den dose peoble must haf been pad off for some blace
to go," spoke up Carl.</p>

<p>"Mayhap the Jurgens outfit are in there?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking," continued Matt.</p>

<p>"Den ve'd pedder look a leedle oudt or ve vill be gedding
indo some hod vater."</p>

<p>"You and Carl slip into the edge of the timber, Dick,"
said Matt, "and I'll go on ahead and do some reconnoitring.
If the gang is there I'll find it out, and then I'll
come back and we'll decide what it is best for us to do."</p>

<p>"You're cutting out all the rough work for yourself,"
demurred Dick.</p>

<p>"I'm the one best able to stand it," was the answer.
"You're far from being yourself, old chap, and Carl is
too much afraid of spooks to accomplish anything."</p>

<p>"I do feel a bit groggy on my feet, and that's a fact,"
admitted Ferral, staggering to the edge of the brush and
dropping wearily down. "That nick on the head took
the starch all out of me, but I'll feel better after a while.
Go ahead, Matt, but don't stir up any trouble. We're
not in shape to stand off that gang of pirates."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to let the scoundrels see me,"
Matt answered as he moved away.</p>

<p>Keeping to the edge of the timber, he was able to
reach a point abreast of the hut without showing himself.
From the place where he came to a halt he could
look across a narrow stretch of clear ground and see a
window in the rear wall of the hovel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>A look through the window would tell him all he
wanted to know, and he dropped down on hands and
knees and began crawling across the open space.</p>

<p>He appreciated to the full Dick's suggestion as to not
stirring up trouble. Jurgens, according to Matt's surmise,
probably had two men with him and the young
fellow who had played the part of Matt in making the
diamond haul. This made four against Matt and his
two comrades&mdash;an overwhelming force, when it is remembered
that undoubtedly the thieves were armed.</p>

<p>Matt gained the place under the window without
making a noise; then, raising cautiously, he pressed his
face to the glass.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, a piece of cloth had been placed
over the window on the inside. A broken pane in the
window, however, enabled him to listen for sounds which
would let him know whether or not there was really any
one in the hut.</p>

<p>There were no voices and no sound of any stir, but
Matt's keen ear detected the slow, regular breathing of
some one asleep. And there was only one sleeper&mdash;he
was positive of that.</p>

<p>For a few moments he debated the question. Should
he step boldly into the hut and find out who the person
was, or would it be better to go back after Carl and Dick
so as to have a superior force in case of a clash?</p>

<p>Matt decided that the move was for him to make.
Going back into the edge of the timber, he cut himself
a stout bludgeon; thus armed, he stepped quietly around
to the front of the hut and laid a hand on the door.</p>

<p>It was locked.</p>

<p>A little examination assured him that the bolt was not
strong enough to resist a determined onslaught, and he
boldly hurled himself against the door.</p>

<p>It went crashing inward, and Matt pitched forward
across the floor and almost lost his footing.</p>

<p>A shout of consternation went up, and Matt saw a
form spring erect and stand facing him.</p>

<p>It was the form of a youth about Matt's own age,
wearing a dingy sweater and frayed corduroy trousers.
At the first glance each recognized the other.</p>

<p>"King, or I'm a Reub!"</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs! The fellow that played that
dodge on Townsend!"</p>

<p>Matt cleared the distance separating him from the
youth at a leap; but the other had jumped backward, at
the same time pulling a weapon from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Don't you go and make a sucker play, Motor Matt!"
cried Dashington warningly.</p>

<p>"Put up that revolver!" ordered Matt, staring sternly
at the youth and taking a fresh grip on the handle of
the club.</p>

<p>"You've got a picture of me making a funny play like
that&mdash;I don't think. Throw away your club and I'll
throw away this pepper box. Gee, but wouldn't it uppercut
you, the way we resemble each other? Say, you
ought to be delighted to see me instead of trying to make
a pass at my block with that stick. I wasn't looking for
you to drop in on me so soon."</p>

<p>"I doubt if you were expecting me to drop in on you
at all," said Matt sarcastically. "Where are Jurgens, and
Whistler, and Bangs?"</p>

<p>"Close by, cull. Don't make too much noise or they'll
get next to you and me and blow in on us."</p>

<p>"Where are those diamonds?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Hand me an easy one."</p>

<p>"You ought to know. You're the one that stole them,
and you stole them for Jurgens and his pals."</p>

<p>"Part of that's on the level. I did lift the bag of
sparks, and it really seems as though I went to all that
trouble for Jurgens and his pals. Anyhow, I didn't help
myself so you could see it. Don't get to hearing funny
noises under your bonnet, now, but drop the club and
let's be sociable. If you&mdash;&mdash; Wow, but you're chain
lightning, and then some!"</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Matt had thrown the club. It struck
the revolver in Dashington's hand and knocked it clear
to the opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>Before Dashington could recover it, Matt was upon
him and there was a short wrestling match, catch-as-catch-can.
Being far and away Dashington's superior
in science, Matt was only about two minutes in laying his
antagonist on his back. When they fell, they knocked
over a table, and the racket it made brought a stifled
cry to Dashington's lips.</p>

<p>"They'll get wise to us! You're queering yourself,
King. Let me up, quick! I can hear some one coming."</p>

<p>"You're my prisoner!" said Matt sharply.</p>

<p>"We'll both be prisoners of Jurgens and his gang if
you don't take a tumble to the rights of this. Let me
up, I tell you, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the hurrying steps outside reached the door.</p>

<p>"What's going on here, Matt?" came the excited voice
of Dick Ferral, as he and Carl flung into the room.</p>

<p>"I've just captured that double of mine," answered
Matt. "If we hang onto him possibly we can make him
tell us something about Jurgens and the diamonds."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister!" mumbled Dashington, "wouldn't that give
your thinker a twist? Pass it up, King. If you won't
take your knees off my chest, then give me a chance
to heave a little of the straight guff at you."</p>

<p>"Pick up that revolver, Dick," said Matt, nodding toward
the weapon. "Keep it in your hands and don't
let this fellow lose your eyes for a moment. He wants
to talk, and we're going to let him, but if he tries to
bolt, he's going to wish that he had thought twice before
he tried it."</p>

<p>Dick hurried to the weapon and gathered it in, then
Matt got up and let Dashington regain his feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A FRIEND FROM THE ENEMY'S CAMP.</p>


<p>"You blokes are wise guys&mdash;I don't think," grinned
Dashington. "Motor Matt is cracked up to be such a
phenom. that I had a warm guess he'd know who wrote
that letter first crack out of the box."</p>

<p>"What letter are you talking about?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"The one you found in your mail this morning. My
stationery wasn't the sort they use in polite correspondence,
but I was in luck to have even that. An old letter
of Bangs', Bangs' notebook and Bangs' pencil helped me
out. I'll bet eight big iron louies you never once suspected
me of dropping that letter in the mails; and yet,
who else was there for you to suspect? Didn't think
Jurgens would do it, did you? Or Whistler? Or
Bangs? Get wise, Motor Matt, get wise. There's work
ahead for the lot of us, and the longer we hang off about
it, the harder it's likely to be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt and his friends listened to this line of talk with
a good deal of wonder, but they were not disposed, just
then, to take Dashington's word for anything.</p>

<p>"You say you wrote that letter?" queried Matt, noting
how the youth's talk harmonized with the letter's contents.</p>

<p>"Want me to make a song out of it and set it to
music? You haul considerable freight, in a general way,
but you haven't taken on much of a load this trip."</p>

<p>"You're the swab Carl and I gave the letter to on the
levee, all right," spoke up Dick.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the word. Swab! That expresses it nicely.
Because of that letter, which I didn't want, I got
rung into the biggest Jonah play that ever hip-locked with
me. As a consequence my ticket is merely a souvenir.
And now here comes Motor Matt and roughs things up
in good old Texas style. That's dead tough luck and
would bring tears to a pair of glass eyes."</p>

<p>"You stole the diamonds?"</p>

<p>"I played understudy to Motor Matt and lifted the
sparks. I walked two long blocks with them concealed
upon my person, then Whistler handed me a fistful of
fives twice, right where they started the slumber song.
Was I down? Yes, indeed, and for several minutes.
When I rounded to and took a fresh grasp of the situation,
Jurgens, Whistler and Bangs had chugged away
in their auto and had forgotten to leave the dazzlers."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Matt grimly. "You robbed Townsend and
then Jurgens and his men robbed you."</p>

<p>"I hope I may drop if that wasn't the way of it. It
was a lesson for me, I think; anyhow, it's a mortal cinch
I got a horrible sorry on for what I'd done. 'They
played me for a mark,' I says to myself, 'and got the
sparklers; now I'll turn to and help Motor Matt get
them back again.' That's why I wrote that letter, and I
dropped it in a mail box just before I pushed off in a
boat and floated down the river. Happened to meet a
colored brother fishing; I told him I wanted to go to
Bayou Yamousa, and the colored brother happened to
know the way; also he happened to have a mule and a
wagon, and he brought me here. I didn't think you'd
be along before night, and I was just keeping myself as
retired as possible while waiting for you to get here.
This shanty looked good to me, and as I was some
fagged on account of the night's labor, I locked the door,
stretched myself out and have been pounding my ear
ever since."</p>

<p>"How did you know Jurgens, Whistler and Bangs were
coming to this place?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>His confidence in Dashington was increasing. This
would not have been the case had Dashington tried to
deny, or smooth over, the part he had played in the robbery.
He was cheerfully admitting his guilt, and the
cause he had for turning against Jurgens and his men
seemed sufficiently adequate.</p>

<p>Dashington told how he had discovered the coat, and
showed the memorandum book found in the pocket. The
notation: "If our plant works, and we get separated after
the diamonds are lifted, am to meet J. and W. at Bayou
Yamousa," appealed particularly to Matt. It showed
Dashington's reason for coming to Bayou Yamousa, and
for asking Matt and his friends to join him there.</p>

<p>"Do you know positively," asked Matt, "that Jurgens
is in this vicinity?"</p>

<p>"I've seen their camp," replied Dashington, "but I was
foxy enough not to let them see me. I'm not altogether
a flat, even if I did let Jurgens and Company touch me
up and pull their chestnuts out of the blaze. I've about
decided to cut out the crooked work entirely, and it's up
to Motor Matt and his pals to give me a fresh chance.
Of course you can pinch me, and land me in the pen,
but that would hardly be square after I have helped you
get back the diamonds."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said Matt.</p>

<p>"Joe Dashington, with the accent on the 'dash.'"</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Every place. I seem to have broken out in New Orleans
just at the right time to mix things for everybody.
Don't let it get past you that I didn't know what I was
up against when Jurgens asked me to lift the stones. I
was on the make, and went into it with my eyes wide.
I'm not turning on the gang entirely because I have a
grouch, but because I've about concluded that bunko
work is a losing game."</p>

<p>"You're right about that, Dashington," averred Matt.
"Crooked business is bad business, and you show your
good sense in wanting to cut loose from it. What do you
expect of us?"</p>

<p>"I'm in wrong," replied Dashington, "but maybe I can
get over that if you'll help. Suppose I join you and help
you recover the diamonds. Will that pay for letting me
start for unknown regions, and then doing the nice, genteel
dip for the rest of the time I'm on earth?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why it won't," said Matt, in a kindly
tone. "You look to me like a chap who could do big
things if you went at it in the right way."</p>

<p>"Landed! Landed and strung! I'm hooked, King,
and you might give me your hand. I've got the gaff
from the strong-arm push for the last time. Just have
your pal put that gun in his pocket and I'll feel easier."</p>

<p>"Put up the thing, Dick," said Matt. "Dash can be
trusted. He's going to help us recover the diamonds, and
in return for his service we're to let him go wherever he
wants to."</p>

<p>"Aber vill he make goot mit vat he says?" chirped
Carl.</p>

<p>"I'm Class A at making good," said Dashington,
"when I tackle a job of my size. I can handle this one.
But where's the balloonobile, the flying wonder that has
shaken the Crescent City from centre to circumference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and clear across to Algiers? I haven't noticed it," and
Dashington stepped to the door and made a hasty survey
of the shore of the bayou.</p>

<p>"You're looking too low, mate," said Dick. "She
bounced up on a live oak and you can't see her for moss."</p>

<p>Dashington whirled with a jump.</p>

<p>"Wrecked?"</p>

<p>"Demolished. She's sailed the skies for the last time,
and it was a bullet brought her down."</p>

<p>"A bullet?"</p>

<p>"Yes," put in Matt. "It was fired from somewhere
in the timber, put the motor out of business and made
holes in the gas bag. We all of us had narrow
escapes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You look the part."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who fired that shot?"</p>

<p>A worried expression came over Dashington's face.</p>

<p>"Who else but some of that sure-thing crowd?" he
returned. "This boggles the situation. They know you're
here, and when they find you weren't finished up out of
hand they'll come looking for you. This sort of puts a
crimp in our prospects, Motor Matt. Getting the sparks
isn't going to be so easy. Jurgens and his crowd are
over by the wagon road with an automobile, and if they
think we're wise to them they may take the machine and
hike."</p>

<p>"We've got to get back those diamonds," declared Matt.</p>

<p>"If we don't, I'd look pretty asking you to pull the pin
on me, wouldn't I? Sure we've got to get 'em back,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Belay there, with your jaw tackle," came excitedly
from Dick, in a half whisper.</p>

<p>He had been standing by the open door, and he suddenly
drew back and hurried up to the other boys.</p>

<p>"Jurgens just showed up on the bank of the bayou,"
announced Dick, "and he looks as though he might be
laying a course for the hut."</p>

<p>"We're double-crossed!" muttered Dashington. "The
head knocker of the push will be next to us in half a
minute, and that means a run to safety in the chug wagon
with all hands and the sparks."</p>

<p>"No," said Matt, a thought darting through his mind.
"There are enough of us here to capture Jurgens. He
may find out about us, but he won't be able to get away
with the information."</p>

<p>"Now you're making a noise like a winner," whispered
Dashington exultantly. "That's the play. Around the
door, lads, and grab him from all sides when he pushes
in. Don't let him yell. If he manages to put up a roar,
Whistler and Bangs will hear it and get curious. They've
got rifles with them&mdash;and a bullet is a hard thing to
dodge if it's sent right."</p>

<p>Jurgens was already close to the hut&mdash;so close that
there was not the slightest doubt but that he was intending
to investigate it. He was probably wondering what
had become of the boys from the air ship, and was
abroad with the intention of locating them, if possible.</p>

<p>Carl and Dick got behind the door, while Matt and
Dashington pressed up close to the wall.</p>

<p>The footsteps came nearer and nearer, and then, just
as Jurgens put his foot across the threshold, Matt and
Dashington sprang for him.</p>

<p>Dashington threw his arms about the man's throat
and hung to him like a leech, while Matt seized a hand
he was pushing toward his hip. In the struggle that followed,
all three fell through the door and rolled off the
step and onto the ground.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BAG OF DIAMONDS.</p>


<p>Jurgens divined instantly that he had got himself into
a serious predicament; but his predicament was even
greater than the four boys imagined during the first part
of their struggle with him.</p>

<p>The scoundrel fought with the fury of a cornered
panther, clawing, kicking and even trying to use his
teeth. Dashington exerted himself entirely to prevent an
outcry, and this left Matt to do most of the fighting until
Carl and Dick hurled themselves through the door and
lent their assistance.</p>

<p>With four against him, Jurgens had no hope; nevertheless,
his desperation was so great that he vainly tried
to continue his one-sided battle.</p>

<p>Carl found a piece of rope somewhere in the hut, and
while he, and Matt, and Dashington held Jurgens, Dick
put the lashings on his hands and feet and made them
secure with hard and fast sailor's knots. A twisted
handkerchief tied between Jurgens' jaws relieved Dashington
of his part of the work, and the boys got up
breathlessly and looked down at their prisoner.</p>

<p>"That's because you didn't play square with me, Jurgens,"
said Dashington, leering into the baleful eyes of
the man at his feet. "I'll back you against all comers,
bar none, for being the most treacherous crook in the
business. But here's where you get it handed to you.
You had it easy, last night, but here's where I give you
the merry ha-ha."</p>

<p>Jurgens tried to talk, but succeeded only in emitting
an incoherent gurgle behind the twisted handkerchief;
then he strained desperately at his bonds, but Dick's knots
were never known to slip.</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it out!" said Dashington. "The ball and
chain are as good as on you so far as your chances for
getting away are concerned. What do you think of
yourself, anyway? This is a regular calcimine finish,
and you're going to do time enough to keep you out of
mischief for quite a spell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vat's dis?" asked Carl, stooping down by the edge of
the step and lifting a small canvas bag.</p>

<p>Dashington stared, then jumped into the air and shook
his hat.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, this isn't luck!" he remarked, smothering his
hilarity with a tremendous effort. "Not at all! And yet
it's as natural as can be. Of course he wouldn't trust
the sparks with either Whistler or Bangs. He keeps
them himself, and when he goes out hunting for Motor
Matt he totes them along. The bag drops out as we roll
off the step, and hides itself up close to the wall of the
cabin. Carl finds it&mdash;and maybe we're not all to the
good? Take it from me, we are."</p>

<p>"Are the diamonds in that bag, Dash?" demanded
Matt, scarcely daring to credit his ears.</p>

<p>"Nowhere else, cull," exulted Dashington. "I couldn't
forget that bag. It has played a big part in my life, even
if it hasn't played a long one."</p>

<p>"Well, shiver me!" muttered Dick, dropping down on
the step. "If that's not what you call winding this up
in handsome style, you can call me a lubber. Motor
Matt's luck&mdash;that's what did it."</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" fluttered Carl, doing a two-step. "We're
der fellers, und don'd you forged dot! Der tiamonts is
pack, we haf der tiamonts pack, und eferyt'ing iss so
lofely as I can't tell. Hoop-a-la!"</p>

<p>"Stow it, neighbor!" warned Dashington. "We've got
our hooks on the sparks, but we're not liable to keep them
if you make too much noise. Whistler and Bangs are
somewhere in the timber, so don't advertise the fact that
we're here and have the stones. Look into the bag,
Matt. Make sure it's no counterfeit."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Dick, tempering his glad feelings
until a further examination was made. "Open the
pouch, Matt, and look into it. If the old hunks has fooled
us with a bag of pebbles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He hasn't," cut in Matt. "Look here!"</p>

<p>He pulled one hand from the bag and held up a diamond
in the sun. There could be no doubt, after that.</p>

<p>"But are they <i>all</i> there?" demanded Dashington. "The
bag hasn't shrunk any since I first set my gig lamps onto
it, still a few of the stones might have been taken out.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>Matt, Carl and Dick had all seen the diamonds just
as they had come from the idol's head, and they were all
firmly of the belief that the stones in the bag bulked as
large as ever.</p>

<p>"This," said Matt, after he had retied the bag and put
it away in the breast of his coat, "makes it necessary for
us to clear out of here as soon as possible. The question
is, how are we to do it?"</p>

<p>"The nearest burg is Chef Menteur," answered Dashington.
"We could go that far on our kicks and catch
a train into N. O."</p>

<p>"Und leaf dot Jurgens feller pehindt?" protested Carl.</p>

<p>"He'd be something of a load to carry," said Dick.</p>

<p>"One of us could go to the nearest plantation and get
a wagon," suggested Dashington.</p>

<p>"Und vile dot feller vas gone, Whistler und Pangs
mighdt show oop und blay hop mit der resdt oof us."</p>

<p>"There are four of us," said Matt, "and I think, if we
had a long pole, we could hang Jurgens to it and carry
him. He has been the ringleader in every plot that was
directed against Townsend and the iron chest. It's
right that he should pay the penalty of his misdeeds,
even if Whistler and Bangs should never be caught. We
let him go once, you remember, Dick, when he was in our
hands, and now, just because of it, we lost the <i>Hawk</i>, and
came within one of losing the diamonds."</p>

<p>"That's a good spiel Motor Matt is giving us," declared
Dashington. "I'll go and look for a long pole, and
while I'm about it, you fellows tie Jurgens' hands in front
of him."</p>

<p>Dashington was probably ten minutes getting the pole.
By the time he was back, Jurgens' hands had been released
and rebound in front of him. The pole was slipped
between his hands and feet, and Matt and Dick, at one
end, and Carl and Dashington, at the other, lifted it to
their shoulders.</p>

<p>Jurgens hung downward, the pole catching the ropes
that bound him and holding him suspended. His position
was far from comfortable, but the boys could not help
that.</p>

<p>"I'm wise to the road we've got to take," said Dashington,
"so this end of the pole had better travel ahead.
We'll come out on the turnpike a half mile the other
side of where I saw the automobile. It won't be many
minutes before Bangs and Whistler will begin to wonder
what became of Jurgens and the sparks, and they'll probably
go out on a hunt. Luck seems to be on our side,
so I'm hoping they sidestep us."</p>

<p>The ends of the pole were shifted so that Carl and
Dashington could travel ahead. Dashington had his
bearings, and he led off as briskly as he could, considering
that the thick timber and the long pole made it necessary
to pick their way with some care.</p>

<p>"You can see, fellows," philosophized Matt, from the
rear, "what greed will do for a man. Jurgens wouldn't
trust the diamonds with Whistler and Bangs. He had to
take them with him. If he hadn't had them, the bag of
loot wouldn't be in our hands now."</p>

<p>"Jurgens is a four-ply wonder," said Dashington. "He
was greedy with me, and that's how I came to scratch
my entry in his free-for-all grafting game, I hope they
give him ninety-nine years at hard labor."</p>

<p>What Jurgens' thoughts were as he was pitched and
swayed along and listened to this talk, did not appear.
He was probably meditating on the changeable nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of human affairs, and thinking of the many times he had
had the treasure of the Man from Cape Town in his hands
and had failed, in the final pinch, to get away with it.</p>

<p>As they got farther and farther into the timber, Matt
counseled silence. They were drawing close to the road
and their voices might carry to the ears of Whistler or
Bangs, if they happened to be abroad.</p>

<p>After that the journey was continued in silence, the
lads pausing, now and then, to change the pole from one
shoulder to the other.</p>

<p>Everything was going swimmingly, and Matt was looking
ahead to an easy jaunt along the road into Chef
Menteur, and then a comfortable ride on the railroad
back to New Orleans, when Carl and Dashington suddenly
laid back on the pole and whirled around to get
the front end farther back into the timber.</p>

<p>Matt and Dick were naturally surprised at this quick
move. They were on the point of speaking when Dashington
laid a warning finger on his lips and motioned for
the pole and its burden to be let down.</p>

<p>"What's up?" whispered Matt, when Carl and Dashington
had pressed close.</p>

<p>"The benzine cart is right ahead of us!" answered
Dashington.</p>

<p>"Oof ve hat gone anodder foot," added Carl, "ve
vould haf come oudt righdt on Whistler und Pangs."</p>

<p>"They're sitting in the front seats with a couple of
rifles over their knees," finished Dashington. "Go take
a look, Matt."</p>

<p>Matt crept forward to a place from which he could
get a good view of the wagon road. The automobile
was pulled out on the roadside, and brush had been cut
and piled over the bonnet in order to screen the car from
travelers along the highway.</p>

<p>Whistler and Bangs did not appear, as yet, to be very
much worried over the prolonged absence of Jurgens.
They were lounging in the car, their feet on the dashboard
and pipes between their lips. Bangs was in his
shirt sleeves, and across the lap of each lay a rifle.</p>

<p>As Motor Matt surveyed the situation, he felt a pang
to think that those two rascals would escape the penalty
of their evil actions. This thought led to another which
caused the young motorist's pulses to leap with an inspiration.</p>

<p>Turning in his tracks, he made his way silently back
to his waiting companions.</p>

<p>"I've got a scheme, pards," he whispered. "How'd
you like to ride back to New Orleans in Jurgens' automobile?"</p>

<p>"Who can run the thing, Matt?" asked Dashington.</p>

<p>"I can," was the answer. "I used to be in the business."</p>

<p>"How'll ve get der pupple?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>"Here's the scheme," said Matt, and drew the other
three close while he talked.</p>
<hr class="chap" />




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DARING PLOT.</p>


<p>"In order to get to New Orleans," said Matt, in a low
tone, "we'll have to head west along the road. Now, if
we work the scheme, my part in it is settled, as I am the
only one who can run the car. I shall have to stay close
here, and you three can settle it among yourselves as to
what parts you will take in pushing the deal through.
Two of you will carry Jurgens half a mile westward, and
wait at the edge of the road, ready to lift Jurgens into
the car and to hop aboard when it comes along. One of
you, I am not particular which, will go about a stone's
throw farther into the timber and wait about half an hour
in order that the two who are to tote Jurgens get to their
proper place at the roadside. Then, the one who is in
the timber will set up a hoarse yell for Whistler and
Bangs, and will fire off one of the revolvers. Do you
catch my drift?"</p>

<p>"It vas too many for me," said Carl.</p>

<p>"I can't rise to it, either," added Dick.</p>

<p>"See if I've guessed it right," spoke up Dashington.
"The fellow that does the shooting and yelling in the
timber will try to make Whistler and Bangs think he is
Jurgens. The guess is that Whistler and Bangs will
leave the auto and rush off to help Jurgens. Then what,
Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"Then I run to the car and start it down the road."</p>

<p>"Und vat pecomes mit der feller in der timber?" asked
Carl.</p>

<p>"He runs for the road as soon as he hears Whistler
and Bangs pounding through the brush," explained
Matt. "He will angle off toward the turnpike and reach
it way this side of where the other two are with Jurgens.
I'll take the first fellow in, then we'll slam the machine
through and pick up the other two of you and Jurgens.
After that we ought to have clear sailing right into New
Orleans. And, furthermore, at the first town west we
can have officers come back and hunt for the two thieves
we leave behind. By making a move like that, we'll not
only give ourselves a lift into the city, but, better still,
we'll take from Whistler and Bangs their only means of
escape out of the country."</p>

<p>"That's the dope!" chuckled Dashington. "Anything
that puts Whistler and Bangs on the slide makes a hit
with me. It's a cinch this gang won't forget in a hurry
what they did to Joe Dashington, nor what Dash did to
even the score. I've got my place picked out."</p>

<p>"Vich iss it?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"I'm the fellow to go in the woods, shake loads out of
the pepper box and put up a roar."</p>

<p>"That means, Carl," said Matt, "that you and Dick
will have to look after Jurgens. We'll give you half an
hour to get where you're going. At the end of that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Dash will begin his racket. Then it's up to me to start
the machine."</p>

<p>"You've picked out the hot end of it for yourself,
Motor Matt," remarked Dashington. "From your talk
one would think it the easiest piece of work on the job,
but I'm jerry that it's some different. There's a lot of
brush piled in front of the car, and on top of it. You
won't have much time to get it out of the way."</p>

<p>"I don't expect to carry it off by the armful," said
Matt, "but to start the car and drive through it and
over it."</p>

<p>"Then it's a guess, and only a guess," pursued Dashington,
"that both Whistler and Bangs will rush into the
timber to give Jurgens a helping hand. Suppose only one
of them goes? You'll be in a fine row of stumps trying
to steal the machine with a man looking at you over the
sights of a rifle!"</p>

<p>"That's the chance I take," said Matt coolly. "We're
all taking chances, for that matter, and you're taking as
many as any one else, Dash."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Dashington, "I'm satisfied if the rest
of you are. Ring the gong, Motor Matt, and we'll take
our corners."</p>

<p>"You and Carl had better move, Dick," said Matt, nodding
toward Jurgens and the pole. "Pick up your man
and start. Do you feel equal to it?" he added, turning an
anxious look on the sailor.</p>

<p>"Equal to anything, mate," answered Dick, "now that
we've got the diamonds. Only don't lose the stones, that's
all. Grab your end of the pole, Carl," he added.</p>

<p>Carl was as happy a Dutchman as one could have found
in seven states. He was morbidly fond of excitement,
and he liked always to be "in the midst of alarms"&mdash;providing
there was nothing supernatural about the alarms.
His face fairly shone as he picked up his end of the pole
and staggered away with it.</p>

<p>It was only a moment before Carl, Dick and their
swinging burden was out of sight; and less than a minute
more until a wild, hair-raising yell for help came from
the direction taken by the two boys.</p>

<p>Matt and Dashington gave a jump of consternation.
They realized at once what must have happened. Undoubtedly
Jurgens had got rid of his gag, unknown to
Dick or Carl, and had given vent to the yell.</p>

<p>Answering cries came almost instantly from the direction
of the automobile.</p>

<p>There was not much time for Matt and Dashington to
think what should be done, but their wits were keen and
they thought along the same line.</p>

<p>"I'll draw them off, Matt," muttered Dashington, and
sped into the wood.</p>

<p>There was no time for Matt to reply, for the crashing
of brush proved that one or both of the men who had
been in the car were close upon him.</p>

<p>Flinging himself to one side, Matt crouched on his
knees behind a tree. Whistler and Bangs rushed into
sight.</p>

<p>"Where'n thunder did that yell come from?" cried
Whistler.</p>

<p>"Off to the left, there," answered Bangs, indicating the
direction taken by Carl and Dick.</p>

<p>For an instant Matt's hopes went down, and he had a
mental picture of Jurgens being rescued, and Carl and
Dick having trouble with those long rifles.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, however, Dashington was heard
from.</p>

<p>"This way, Whistler! Bangs! Quick! The diamonds!
The diamonds!"</p>

<p>The voice was hoarse and a close imitation of Jurgens'.
And then that mention of the diamonds was a masterstroke.</p>

<p>"Somebody's taking the diamonds!" yelped Whistler,
bounding straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Confound Jurgens for carryin' 'em!" fumed Bangs,
hurling himself after Whistler.</p>

<p>Matt's time to get active had now arrived. With an
exultant heart he jumped to his feet and raced for the
automobile.</p>

<p>He had to kick aside some of the brush to get at the
crank, and the engine was slow in turning over; but,
finally, he had the motor popping and settling down into
a steady hum.</p>

<p>Into the car he leaped, there was a moment's work
with the handle bars, a twist at the steering wheel and
the car leaped toward the road, scattering the brush right
and left.</p>

<p>Once on the highway and headed westward, fresh difficulties
confronted Matt. His carefully laid plan had been
only partly carried out, owing to the untimely yell from
Jurgens.</p>

<p>Carl and Dick had had no time to get very far down
the road, and Dashington would be put to it to double
back and get around Whistler and Bangs.</p>

<p>Matt slowed the car and snailed along on the low
speed, looking anxiously the while into the timber that
edged the road.</p>

<p>He saw nothing of Dashington, who would presumably
be the first one he picked up, and off somewhere in
the dusky confines of the wood he heard the snarling
report of a rifle.</p>

<p>His heart almost stood still at that.</p>

<p>At whom had the shot been fired? And had it reached
its mark?</p>

<p>Matt thought of Dashington. In spite of Dashington's
rapid past, there was something about the young fellow
that was attractive, and Matt was beginning to like
him.</p>

<p>It would have been a sad commentary on the course
of events if Dashington was to be shot down just on the
threshold of a better career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to signal to his friends the location of the
car, Matt honked loud and long.</p>

<p>Again came a rifle shot, this time much closer, and
Matt heard the whistle of the ball through the air.</p>

<p>That meant, if it meant anything, that Dashington was
coming toward the road, and that Whistler and Bangs
were following him and shooting as they came. Matt
dared not stop the car, for there would be no time to
crank up and he did not dare trust the engine to take
the spark, even after a short stop.</p>

<p>Presently, to Matt's anxious ears came a crashing of
bushes and a sound of hard breathing. The noise came
from a little way ahead, and he drove the car forward
at a faster speed.</p>

<p>He could hear voices now, coming out of the recesses
of the timber&mdash;the voices of Whistler and Bangs
lifted excitedly.</p>

<p>"There he goes, Whistler!"</p>

<p>"Nail him, then, Bangs! He's got the loot and is
trying to make a getaway with it."</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i></p>

<p>Another bullet rattled through the trees and clipped
the air over Matt's head.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, Dashington, apparently unhurt
but nearly spent, staggered into sight.</p>

<p>"Bilked!" he gasped; "I bilked 'em for fair."</p>

<p>"Into the tonneau, quick!" shouted Matt.</p>

<p>Dashington staggered to the running board and fell
sprawling into the rear of the car.</p>

<p>"They're stealing the car!" howled the voice of Bangs,
who was now close enough to the road to see what was
going on.</p>

<p>"Stop 'em!" roared the panting voice of Whistler. "If
they get away with the car we're done for!"</p>

<p>Away jumped the car on the high speed, throwing dust
and gravel from the rear tires in a shower.</p>

<p><i>Bang! bang!</i> came the harsh notes of the rifles, but
the screen of dust and the excitement of the moment were
not conducive to accurate shooting.</p>

<p>The car raced off, made a turn in the road, and Whistler
and Bangs were left behind.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye out for Dick and Carl, Dash!" shouted
Matt. "They ought to be somewhere around here."</p>

<p>At just that moment, Carl showed himself in the road,
jumping up and down and waving his hat.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE ROAD.</p>


<p>Carl and Dick had Jurgens close to the roadside, and
not much time was lost loading the prisoner into the tonneau.
Carl crawled into the rear seat with Jurgens and
Dashington, and Dick got up in front with Matt.</p>

<p>"What was the shooting about?" asked Dick, smothering
his excitement.</p>

<p>"Whistler and Bangs were taking pot shots at Dash,"
explained Matt. "Jurgens sprung our scheme on us
before we were ready for it."</p>

<p>The car was rushing off down the road again, Matt
looking back toward the turn for some sign of Whistler
and Bangs. The machine had taken another turn before
the baffled robbers had shown themselves.</p>

<p>"Py shinks!" boomed Carl, who had heard Matt's remark,
"I t'ought I should drow fits righdt on der shpot
ven don Jugens feller tuned oop. Ve ditn't know anyt'ing
aboudt it, Matt, aber he hat chewed der handtkerchief
in doo. Tick und me heardt der shooding, und ve
vas schared shtiff. Ve t'ink, meppy, dot you or Tashington
vas hurt."</p>

<p>"It was a close call for Dashington," said Matt. "If
it hadn't been for his quickness and cleverness you two
with Jurgens would have had Whistler and Bangs down
on you like a thousand of brick. They were headed that
way when Dash drew them off. But it's all over now.
We're out of it, and we've got Jurgens' car, and Whistler
and Bangs will have to hoof it. We'll send officers back
from the next town."</p>

<p>"That will be Micheaud," put in Dashington.</p>

<p>"I vonder oof dere iss a blace to eat in der town?"
quavered Carl. "I haf peen lifing on oxcidement all tay,
und now ven der oxcidement iss gone I feel der need oof
somet'ing else."</p>

<p>"Trust Carl to think of his chuck," laughed Dick.
"What I want in the next town is a hat. After that I
can get along until we reach where we're going."</p>

<p>Another handkerchief had been twisted between Jurgens'
jaws in lieu of the one he had gnawed in two.</p>

<p>"There's no need of the gag now, pards," said Matt,
"and you'll make Jurgens more comfortable by taking it
off."</p>

<p>Jurgens' first words, the moment the gag was removed,
were directed at Dashington.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" he hissed, "you're at the bottom of
all this."</p>

<p>"Thanks," grinned Dashington, "that's partly the way
of it."</p>

<p>"How did Motor Matt know where we had gone?"</p>

<p>"I put him next, Jurgens."</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Why, as for that, when you put me down and out,
there in New Orleans, Bangs' coat dropped from the car.
When I corralled my wits I found it. There was a notebook
in the pocket and that gave me a line on your rendezvous."</p>

<p>"Bangs!" snapped Jurgens. "We ought never to have
hooked up with him. He's a sot and a bungler."</p>

<p>"You're a bungler yourself, Jurgens. If you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
treated me square, instead of trying to hog the whole
bag of tricks, I might have kept right on with you and
turned into a promising crook. On the whole, it's a fine
thing for me you let Whistler give me that bump. I was
at the turning point, and that rap on the block gave me a
shove in the right direction."</p>

<p>"You'll do time for stealing those diamonds if my evidence
counts for anything!" snapped Jurgens.</p>

<p>"But it won't. You're fooling yourself with a pipe
dream when you let your little two-by-four run in that
groove. Who was it shot at the air ship? Talk a while
about something sensible."</p>

<p>"Bangs, again!" snorted Jurgens. "He was moseying
along by the bayou and saw the air ship overhead. He
blazed away, making a good shot. That was all right,
but where Bangs was wrong was in hustling off to tell
Whistler and me and not waiting to find out what damage
he had done. As soon as I got Bangs' story, I
made for the bayou. I saw the air ship, all right,
smashed to smithereens in the top of a live oak, but
King, Ferral and the Dutchman had vanished."</p>

<p>"Den you vent to hunt for us," bubbled Carl, "and got
yourself in some drouples."</p>

<p>"You mean," laughed Dashington, with a taunt in his
voice, "that he came to the hut to give us back the diamonds.
It was a raw play, and that was what it
amounted to."</p>

<p>Jurgens, in futile rage, ground his teeth.</p>

<p>"This will be the last of the diamonds," called Matt,
from forward, "so far as you are concerned, Jurgens."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be the last of Townsend too," scowled
Jurgens. "That fellow has dogged me from pillar to
post ever since I left Atlantic City."</p>

<p>Matt and his chums enjoyed that remark.</p>

<p>"You dit all der dogging," said Carl.</p>

<p>"And you young whelps helped Townsend," snarled
Jurgens. "Well, we've made it expensive for you. That
air ship has made its last trip."</p>

<p>Dick Ferral sobered immediately. Recent exciting
events had kept his mind off the untimely fate of the
<i>Hawk</i>, but now the loss of the air ship recurred to him
with added significance.</p>

<p>"I was in love with that craft," said he. "She saved
our lives more than once, and she helped us turn a good
many tricks for law and order. Not only that, but she
has made for us five or six times the amount of money
she cost us. Poor little ship! I suppose she'll hang in
that oak tree till the crack o' doom."</p>

<p>"Forget about it, old chap," said Matt. "Her last
cruise was the best of all, for she helped me redeem my
promise to Archibald Townsend. There's the town
ahead," he added, "and we'll stop there for supper and
to send some one back along the road to capture Whistler
and Bangs."</p>

<p>"They'll keep clear of any one you send," growled
Jurgens, "I'll guarantee that."</p>

<p>"Whose automobile is this, Jurgens?" queried Dick.</p>

<p>"It belongs to a firm in New Orleans," he replied, with
a leer. "We rented it and were going to forget to take
it back."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you leave town when Townsend let you
go, that other time?" Matt went on, hoping for an answer
to a question that had long bothered him.</p>

<p>"Because we believed Townsend had got the loot that
was in the iron chest," said Jurgens, "and we had as much
right to it as he had."</p>

<p>"And you watched Townsend, after that?"</p>

<p>"Every minute, night and day."</p>

<p>Just here Matt swerved from the street of the town
and came to a halt in front of a public house.</p>

<p>"We'll go in and eat, Motor Matt," said Dashington,
with a significant look at the young motorist, "and Carl
and Dick can stay here and keep watch over the machine
and Jurgens. We can send them a hand-out."</p>

<p>Matt, seeing that there was some object back of Dashington's
suggestion, acquiesced. They got down from
the car and went into the tavern, took a seat in the dining
room and sent out a hot meal to those in the car.</p>

<p>Matt and Dashington were alone in the dining room
and, after the waiter had served them and gone away,
they were able to talk privately.</p>

<p>"I had something up my sleeve, cull," said Dashington,
"when I asked you to come in here with me. Here's
where I have to quit you."</p>

<p>"Why can't you go on to New Orleans, Dash?" asked
Matt. "I know Townsend. He's a good fellow, and
he'll be so glad to get the diamonds back that I know he
will not make you any trouble."</p>

<p>"You might be able to swing Townsend, all right,"
returned Dashington, "but the chap that has it in for
me, old fel, is Jurgens. You've heard how he feels.
He'd split on me, as sure as fate, and ring me in on the
deal. No, I've got to duck, and right from this town.
I've done what I could to square myself, and I'm going
to put as much country between me and New Orleans as
I can. It will be best, all around. You and I look too
much alike to be in the same section of the country."</p>

<p>"You're going to stay straight, are you?" asked Matt,
quietly.</p>

<p>"As long as I'm on the turf!" declared Dashington.
"There's my hand on it."</p>

<p>Matt grasped cordially the hand Dashington offered
him.</p>

<p>"Between two fellows who look so much alike as do
you and I, Dash," said Matt, "there ought to be a bond
of friendship. As long as you're straight, if you ever
need help and I'm within hailing distance, let me know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Dashington was silent for a space.</p>

<p>"That's mighty good of you," said he finally and in a
low tone. "You've been a good friend to me, and the
police probably won't thank you for letting me get away;
but I appreciate what you've done. Don't let that get
past your guard for a minute."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any relatives?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk along that line," said Dashington.
"If I have, they'll never hear of me until I prove
myself a credit to the family."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, from here?"</p>

<p>"I'll take a side-door Pullman out of the country.
Haven't a guess where I'll land, but I know it will be a
good way off."</p>

<p>"Have you any money?"</p>

<p>Dashington laughed.</p>

<p>"Money? What's that? I haven't a sou markee in
my jeans, Matt, and it's that that made me desperate and
ready to fall in with Jurgens and his bunch. The lack
of a little money puts many a chap to the bad."</p>

<p>Matt drew a roll of bills from his pocket, counted off
several and laid them down beside Dashington's plate.</p>

<p>"There's fifty," said he.</p>

<p>"What's it for?" asked Dashington.</p>

<p>"For you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to take your money, Matt. I hope I'm
not an object of charity."</p>

<p>"Well, I should hope not. I'm not giving it to you,
you understand. It's only a loan, and you can pay it
back next week, next year, or any old time when you get
around to it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dashington.</p>

<p>When Matt got up from the table, he left Dashington
still sitting in his chair. And that was the last he saw
of him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A NEW MAN TAKES A HAND.</p>


<p>It was midnight when the automobile and its passengers
from Bayou Yamousa rolled into New Orleans.
Matt's first call was at police headquarters. Here Jurgens
was left, and a bit of a surprise was sprung.</p>

<p>The assistant chief, Fetterman by name, was on duty,
and the arrival of Jurgens created a mild sensation. Detectives
were even then prowling about the city looking
for Lattimer Jurgens, Whistler, Bangs, and a young man,
name unknown, wearing a slouch hat, sweater and frayed
corduroy trousers. The detectives had not met with the
slightest success, and the bringing in of Jurgens, by
Motor Matt and his chums, naturally created a mild degree
of excitement.</p>

<p>The surprise was in the nature of a question by Fetterman.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, King, from here?"</p>

<p>Matt gave him the number of the house in Prytania
Street where Townsend had taken up his quarters.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Fetterman, with a peculiar glance, "that's
the place where the diamonds were stolen. A new man is
taking a hand in the game. I'll get him at once and
bring him to the place in Prytania Street, but I'd like
to have you and your friends stay there until we arrive.
What this man has to say will be of interest to all of
you."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" inquired Matt, curiously.</p>

<p>"I have promised to let him do his own talking," was
the vague response.</p>

<p>Vastly puzzled, Matt went out to the car, told his
chums what Fetterman had said, and all three of them
wondered and guessed clear to Prytania Street and the
house of Mrs. Thomas.</p>

<p>This time Matt entered by the front way. There was
a light in Townsend's room. The shade was drawn, but
a glow could be seen through it.</p>

<p>Matt was announced by a sleepy domestic, and he and
his chums were shown up the stairs to the sick chamber.
Cassidy was on duty as usual, and Townsend was wide
awake and sitting up in his bed.</p>

<p>"What luck?" he asked, quaveringly.</p>

<p>"The very best, Mr. Townsend," answered Matt, cheerily,
and drew the bag from his coat and laid it in Townsend's
hands.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are these the diamonds?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And where is Jurgens, Whistler, Bangs and the others
who helped them commit the robbery?"</p>

<p>"They have all escaped&mdash;with the exception of Jurgens
and the young fellow, Dashington, who impersonated
me. Jurgens is in jail, and I allowed Dashington
to go."</p>

<p>"You allowed him to go?" asked Townsend, nonplused.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Matt, "for the reason that, if he had
not helped us I never could have kept my promise to
you."</p>

<p>"Nothing much matters," said Townsend, with a long
sigh of content, "now that I have the diamonds back. I
don't care who helped you, or how it happened, Motor
Matt always accomplishes the thing he sets out to do. I
have been better ever since you left here, last night. Now
I shall get well, and get well quick. Give me your hand,
my boy! And the rest of you&mdash;come here and let me
thank you."</p>

<p>After Carl and Dick had crowded up to the bed and
shaken hands with Townsend, the latter would have returned
the bag to Matt and had him take the stones at
once to the address on St. Charles Avenue; but, even as
the request was being made, there was another ring at
the gate bell, and then at the door, and the servant came
up to announce "two men from headquarters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two men from headquarters," muttered Townsend,
bewildered. "Who can they be and what do they want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what they want," said Matt, "but one
of them is the assistant chief, Mr. Fetterman."</p>

<p>"Something else is going wrong," fretted Townsend,
"and I know it. These diamonds seem to carry a curse
with them."</p>

<p>"D'you feel strong enough, cap'n, to have more visitors?"
asked Cassidy.</p>

<p>"I should be badly worried if I couldn't hear, without
delay, what Fetterman and this other man have to tell
me."</p>

<p>The assistant chief came in accompanied by a blond,
stoutly built person whom he introduced as Mr. Shirley,
of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Mr. Shirley was genial and made friends for himself
right away.</p>

<p>"You're a sick man, I'm told, Mr. Townsend," said
he, "and I'm going to begin at once what I have to say
and come to an end as briefly as possible. I had best
begin in South Africa where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"South Africa?" echoed Townsend.</p>

<p>Shirley nodded.</p>

<p>"A man named Hobart, an American," he went on,
"worked in the Bloemfontein diamond mine. He was a
clever scoundrel and accomplished what many another
man had tried in vain to do, and that was to steal diamonds
out of the workings. How he got them to the
place where he lived is a mystery that has not yet been
solved, for Hobart kept his plan strictly to himself and
did not even let his confederate in the enterprise know
how the thieving was done.</p>

<p>"In the house where Hobart had his rooms the diamonds
were carefully secreted in the head of a particularly
vicious-looking idol. Hobart used to show the idol
to his friends, taking it from an iron chest where it was
carefully packed in sawdust, and to which, after a few
moments of exhibiting, he was always careful to return
it.</p>

<p>"Hobart declared that the head was a fragment of
the malefic Obboney, a deity of the Koromantyn, or Gold
Coast, negroes. This was entirely fiction, for, it afterward
developed, he had had the head carved by a man
in the Portuguese settlements, and then steeped in a
deadly liquor which caused it to give off a poisonous effluvia.
This was intended as a protection for the stolen
diamonds.</p>

<p>"In due course, Hobart and his confederate, Sharpe,
an Australian, quit the diamond mines and prepared to
leave for the States with their booty. They sailed for
England, and from there took a West Indian trader for
the Bahamas. When near the Bahamas, Sharpe demanded
a division of the treasure. Hobart put him off
with some excuse, and then, that night, mysteriously
vanished with a whale boat and his iron chest, leaving
Sharpe behind.</p>

<p>"Sharpe never found out where his treacherous comrade
had gone, nor what he had done with the iron chest.
Moved by a spirit of vengeance, he sailed for England
and told the entire story of the theft of the diamonds
to the head of the syndicate that had charge of the diamond
mines. The case was placed in my hands, and I
traced Hobart to Philadelphia and found that he had
lived there in poverty and had finally died and been
buried in the Potters Field.</p>

<p>"I also learned that Hobart had had a friend, a
wealthy inventor named Townsend. Having reached the
end of my quest, so far as Hobart was concerned, I
turned my attention to finding Townsend, in the hope
that he could tell me something about the iron chest.</p>

<p>"But Townsend seemed every whit as hard to locate
as Hobart had been. He had invented a submarine and
was trying it out somewhere on a long-distance cruise.
I bided my time and, at last, saw an account in a daily
paper of the theft of a submarine belonging to one Captain
Nemo, Jr., from the Inlet at Atlantic City, and of
the pursuit of the submarine by a flying machine.</p>

<p>"I was a little mixed by the name of Captain Nemo,
Jr., but I started out to follow the flying machine. This
was comparatively easy, for wherever the machine was
seen it was reported to the daily press, and all I had to
do was to read the newspapers. Well, to be brief, I
finally reached New Orleans last night. My coming was
most opportune&mdash;a stroke of luck that does not come a
detective's way more than once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>"A big diamond robbery had occurred here. The victim
was one Archibald Townsend, and there were strong
rumors flying about of a head carved from wood, of an
iron chest, and of the thieves mixed up in the robbery
having given their nefarious attentions to Mr. Townsend
before. I talked with the authorities, and they told me
that they were on the trail of the robbers and were doing
their utmost to apprehend them. So, I had perforce to
continue my waiting game, although more than certain
that I was finally on the right track.</p>

<p>"Imagine my surprise and satisfaction when Mr. Fetterman,
here, came to my hotel, a few minutes ago, with
the information that the ringleader of the thieving gang
had been captured, and that the diamonds had been recovered.
We came on here at once, I to explain my mission
to Mr. Townsend, and Mr. Fetterman to vouch for
my story."</p>

<p>Shirley, of Scotland Yard, sank back in his chair, his
mild blue eyes roving whimsically about over the astounded
faces of his listeners.</p>

<p>"Merciful powers!" gasped Townsend. "Can it be
possible that I have been so terribly deceived in that fellow
who called himself the Man from Cape Town? I
was positive of his honesty, although I had not the remotest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
idea, at the time, of what the treasure consisted.
I first met the Man from Cape Town in Philadelphia, and
befriended him. He seemed grateful, and, just before
he died, called me to his bedside and gave me a chart of
an island in the Bahamas. The island was said to have
a cave, and an iron chest was said to be in the cave. I
looked upon the whole story as a fairy tale, but, as I
wanted to test my submarine with a long sea cruise,
promised the man I would go and look for his iron
chest.</p>

<p>"The chest, when found, was to be brought to New
Orleans and opened in the presence of a lady living in
St. Charles Avenue, who, Hobart told me, was his
daughter. The treasure was to be equally divided between
the lady and myself.</p>

<p>"That iron chest seemed to draw upon me all manner
of unfortunate adventures, and I regretted continually
that I had ever had anything to do with it. But I had
given my promise to this Man from Cape Town, and felt
myself bound to carry it out to the letter. I have held
strictly to that policy, and Motor Matt and his friends
have stood loyally by through everything that has happened."</p>

<p>Shirley turned an approving glance on Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"I hear nothing but most excellent reports of Motor
Matt," said he, "and I should like to hear from him, in
detail, all that has happened while he and his friends
were working to recover the diamonds for the last time."</p>

<p>"It will be worth listening to, I can promise you that,"
said Cassidy. "Whenever he does a thing, he has a way
o' his own of getting at it."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on Matt. He saw that he was
in for it, and began at the beginning and went through
with every detail of the adventures recently encountered
by him and his friends.</p>

<p>Every one followed him closely, particularly Shirley.</p>

<p>"From all this it appears," said the Scotland Yard
man, as soon as Matt had finished, "that in getting back
these diamonds for the South African syndicate, you have
lost a ten-thousand-dollar air ship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It didn't cost us that," interposed Matt.</p>

<p>"And have endangered your life and the lives of your
friends," continued the detective, without seeming to
notice the interruption. "I shall include that in my report
when I return the diamonds. Meanwhile, until
Mr. Townsend is satisfied that I have secured stolen
property, the diamonds will remain in the custody of the
New Orleans police department."</p>

<p>Shirley reached for his hat and got up.</p>

<p>"I fear I have tired you, Mr. Townsend," said he, regretfully,
"but it was necessary for me to see you at
once and explain the mistake which, under the circumstances,
it was a perfectly natural one to make. You have
experienced much trouble and worry, and this can never
be made up to you. As for the diamonds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take them," cried Townsend, stretching out the bag
to Fetterman; "I am delighted to get rid of them and
have them off my mind. And I am doubly glad that,
being stolen property, a wrong is to be righted and the
stones returned to their rightful owners. I don't wish
to have anything done for me, Mr. Shirley. I have
sufficient of this world's goods, and you have already
done me the greatest favor possible by taking the diamonds
off my hands. But Motor Matt and his friends,
they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I give you my word that they shall be looked after,"
finished Shirley.</p>

<p>Thereupon he shook hands all around, wished everybody
luck and departed with Fetterman.</p>

<p>The fateful treasure, of course, went with them.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>If there was ever a happy man, Townsend was the one.
So far from grieving him, the loss of the diamonds appeared
to have done him a world of good.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," cried Carl, "dot vas der piggest surbrise
vat efer anypody heardt aboudt! Der Man from
Cape Town vas a t'ief, schust like Jurgens, und ve haf
peen fighding, und vorrying, und making some fools oof
ourselufs over a lod of shtolen tiamonts. Und now, ven
ve lose our air ship in gedding dem pack, in valks a English
feller und takes der tiamonts avay. He geds eferyt'ing
und ve ged nodding&mdash;but bromises."</p>

<p>"Promises are pretty good things, sometimes," said
Townsend, "when they are made by the right sort of
fellow. But you and your friends will not be anything
out, Motor Matt. This Shirley means to do what is
right, and you will be well repaid for the loss of the <i>Hawk</i>
and for your time and trouble."</p>

<p>"The loss of the <i>Hawk</i> is the worst of it," mourned
Dick. "That strikes me harder than anything else."</p>

<p>"She was a wonderful air ship," said Townsend, "and
I don't blame you for feeling cut up over her loss. But
Motor Matt can build another."</p>

<p>"I think I will leave the air-ship business for a while,"
said Matt, "and get into something else. I suppose," he
went on, shifting the subject, "that the English detective
will see that Jurgens gets the full extent of the law?"</p>

<p>"There's no doubt," averred Townsend, "but that Jurgens
will pay dearly for his last attempt to get away with
those fated diamonds."</p>

<p>"And if Whistler and Bangs are captured, they'll share
the same fate. Officers are looking for them now."</p>

<p>"I don't think the officers will catch them, Matt," said
Townsend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"The trail is hot and Whistler and Bangs will have
to travel on foot."</p>

<p>"Even at that, Whistler knows that part of the country
too well. Jurgens, I am sure, is the only member of the
gang who will ever be brought to book. But I am satisfied.
He is the most culpable, and Whistler and Bangs
were only tools."</p>

<p>"What do you think about the way I let Dashington
go, Mr. Townsend?" asked Matt, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Whatever you do, my lad, is all right so far as I
am concerned. On the face of it, it would look as though
you had done wrong; but you were placed in a position
where you could learn what Dashington really was. If,
armed with that knowledge, you thought it right to set
him free, I don't see why any one should find fault with
your judgment."</p>

<p>Matt was glad to have this approval. He felt in his
own heart he had done right, but he wanted to know how
others felt about it.</p>

<p>"You'd better take a little rest now, cap'n," said Cassidy.
"You've been under a good deal of a strain to-night,
and the doctor said you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The strain, as you call it, Cassidy," interrupted
Townsend, with a laugh, "has done me good. Don't go,
Matt," he added, seeing that Matt and his friends were
reaching for their hats, "I'm not quite through with you
yet."</p>

<p>"I'll drop in and see you to-morrow," said Matt. "I
guess you've talked enough for to-night."</p>

<p>"I'm so pleased over getting rid of those diamonds that
I feel as though I could talk all night. You say that
you think, now that the <i>Hawk</i> has been destroyed, you'll
get into some other line of business."</p>

<p>"Yes; something connected with gasoline motors, of
course. I couldn't break away from the motors, you
know."</p>

<p>"Why not go in for submarines?"</p>

<p>"I had thought of that, but couldn't see any place
where there was an opening."</p>

<p>Dick and Carl looked disturbed.</p>

<p>"I can offer you an opening."</p>

<p>"Iss dere some obenings for more as one, Misder
Downsent?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>"I'm a little bit interested in that point myself," added
Dick. "I don't like to see this combination of King,
Ferral &amp; Pretzel broken up."</p>

<p>"It needn't be broken up," said Townsend, "for I am
sure I can take care of all three of you."</p>

<p>"Just what kind of an opening is it, Mr. Townsend?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I will tell you about that later. You remember, I
think, that I asked you to come to New Orleans to help
me in some work that had nothing to do with the iron
chest or the treasure of the Man from Cape Town?"</p>

<p>"I remember that, yes, sir," said Matt.</p>

<p>"We haven't got down to that business yet, and, as I
told Carl, some time ago, it's thrilling, exciting and a bit
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Und, as I toldt you, Misder Downsent," put in Carl,
"dot's der fery t'ing vat ve like. Life vouldt be some
treary blaces mitoudt oxcidement to lifen t'ings oop."</p>

<p>"Before we had a chance to get at this other work of
mine," continued Townsend, "something connected with
that iron chest would bob up and the other business had
to be sidetracked. Now, however, I think we can get at
it without anything to interfere. But the matter will
have to hold over until I am better than I am now.
Perhaps it will be a week before I will be able to discuss
the affair with you. Meanwhile, may I ask you to
remain in New Orleans, at my expense, for that length
of time?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Townsend, if it will oblige you we will
stay here for a week," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to you&mdash;to all of you. Now, I know,
you're fagged out and in need of rest, so I won't keep
you any longer. I suppose you will take that automobile
to the police department and leave it with them to be
turned over to the firm to whom it belongs?"</p>

<p>"We'll do that," said Matt, "before we go to our
hotel."</p>

<p>"It would be wise, I think, to get it off your mind as
soon as possible. And I have your promise to stay in
town for a week?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I know you'll stay, for"&mdash;and here Townsend
gave a confident smile&mdash;"I know that Motor Matt's
word is as good as his bond."</p>

<p>He shook hands with the motor boys, and they went
out of the house, got into the automobile and headed
the machine back toward town.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MASKED_LIGHT" id="THE_MASKED_LIGHT">THE MASKED LIGHT.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>It was the enemy! we were completely trapped. The tables
were turned upon us; yet, even as the fight was lost, we won
it. Shots crossed and recrossed about me. One flash on my
left showed me a man's face and the glitter of a bayonet as
he thrust at me. I struck it on one side with the muzzle
of my gun, firing point-blank into him as I parried it. As he
dropped back another leaped up, stamping on him to gain me.
He fired from the hip, and the powder singed my hair. I
clubbed my musket and struck down at him, slipped on the
bowlder, and down we crashed, clenched together, he, underneath,
falling on his head twelve feet below. His arms
relaxed and I rolled clear. By sheer instinct alone I kept
flat, for men were now leaping down, while the shrill whistle
of a leaden hailstorm passed over me.</p>

<p>For a moment I thought it was the end of us all; but out
of the din I recognized a voice on our right calling shrilly:
Chloe's voice. Our friends were reënforcing us from the
ford. The attackers, caught on the flank, broke and fled. I
rose up at last. The foot of the lighthouse just loomed
faintly visible, and I saw the last of the enemy rush over
the dark heap and gain the shelter of the building.</p>

<p>That dark heap was now linked to our position by a chain
of dead and wounded men; their retreat had cost them more
than the attack.</p>

<p>We had not escaped scatheless. Seven men killed outright,
and nine wounded. Before we had time to move a
single man to a more comfortable position, we were driven
to the shelter of our rocks by a withering fire which broke
out from every window and loophole of the chapel. We
clung to the lee of the rocks. The air was dusty with chips
and splinters of stone.</p>

<p>As I at last recovered my wits, I found that some one else
was sheltering under the same rock. It was Chloe, all
breathless, disheveled, and wringing wet.</p>

<p>"Take mine, capitan," she cried, on seeing me without a
rifle. And she passed me a handful of cartridges from the
bosom of her dress. I loaded in haste, but Henrico began to
roar above the din that not a shot was to be fired. It was
growing lighter every moment, and as yet the enemy could
only aim by the line of the dead and wounded. But, for all
that, the bombardment went on unceasingly.</p>

<p>Chloe, her breath recovered, was, despite her crouching
position, tidying herself to something more woman-like. I
asked her for the news. "Oh," she cried, "they found us,
tumbled on us, but they paid!&mdash;one, two, three, four, five!"
checking them off on her fingers. "Then we heard you.
The sergeant knew you had been surprised&mdash;by the sound
he knew. So, back came ten of us. He was just dying."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued she, braiding her hair. "We all die; but
I put my crucifix round his neck. He said we were to come
to you. So we left him."</p>

<p>Suddenly she paused and listened eagerly, as if to catch
some other sound in the rattle of the firing.</p>

<p>"Listen also, capitan," she said, and pulled me close to
her side where we could get a sight of the sea between two
huge rocks. Faintly, we heard the unmistakable moan of a
steamship's siren. It was the troop ship! she was calling like
some blind, lost thing for guidance.</p>

<p>It was now between light and dark, yet to a ship in the
open a shore light would show boldly out at sea. The same
thought moved both Chloe and myself. She rose to her
feet to peer over the shelter, but something moved in me
hotly, and I pulled her down on the instant and looked over
myself.</p>

<p>Every window of the lighthouse vomited smoke and
flashes. Above, the lantern still cast level rays on the
screen. But no sooner had my eye fallen on the latter, than
I cried out in dismay. A man was crawling hand over hand
on the wire and cutting down the sheet. Already a third
was hanging loose, and a section of light streamed seaward.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I called out to Chloe and pointed out the
sight. Quick as light she whipped up the rifle, but, as she
pulled the trigger, I knocked up the muzzle. And I could
have done no other thing even if it had lost all. It was a
magnificent thing to see a man do; he was a dead man as
soon as sighted, so near he hung to us. Chloe slipped in
another cartridge. In a second we were struggling for
possession of the weapon. At the first grip I cleverly thrust
her back on the rock with the barrel across her chest; only
for a moment, for, with a swift, sinuous movement, she flung
me sideways, and down we went, I underneath. She hissed
like a wild cat, her short upper lip held clear of her white
teeth, and her eyes a depth of black and fire. I believe in
her mad rage she would have worsted me, but, as we grappled,
the walls of the creek fairly shivered under the boom
of a startling concussion. A heavy gun had been fired to
seaward. The war ship had caught the trooper! Another
and another explosion followed, and, at the sound, the rifle
fire dropped. A shout of triumph rang in the rocks and
about us.</p>

<p>We dropped the gun and peered over our rock, and saw a
white flag limply hanging from the lighthouse. The man
on the wire was crawling painfully back to the other side.
I could not help but start up and give him a cheer with the
whole of my breath.</p>

<p>Chloe looked in my face, her black eyes big with wonder,
a child again.</p>

<p>"That's because he is as brave a man as ever carried a
gun," said I.</p>

<p>"Do the Americans always cheer an enemy?" asked she.</p>

<p>"If he's brave."</p>

<p>With that she leaped on to the rock, and, throwing back
her head, sent a shrill "huzza!" to the distant man, who had
now gained the firm ground. He turned and saw us, waved
his hand and fled.</p>

<p>All our men were streaming after Henrico toward the
lighthouse, where the enemy sullenly filed out and flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
down their rifles. Seventeen I counted, all that remained
of the strong command.</p>

<p>Presently the doctors arrived from the cruiser, and began
their grim trade on a flat rock. But the most evil sight was
to see the lighthouse, forgotten by all, unblinkingly staring
into the face of the now open day.</p>

<p>But the night's work had not been wasted by us, for by
sunset we were honored guests on the cruiser, with a passage
home before us.</p>

<p>Chloe had brought off in her uncle's boat the odds and
ends from our lodgings. The anchor cable was rattling
on the deck, and at that we shook hands with her, and said
good-by. She stood and looked at us, and we noticed she
had put on her gala dress. Still she remained, till Gilbert
suddenly cried: "Goodness, we've forgotten. But we'll
send you our debt as soon as we get home to New York&mdash;never
you fear, Chloe."</p>

<p>"No! never," she cried, "not that; no money owing." She
turned, her red lips open and eyes brimming; she stooped,
kissed Gilbert in her arms! swung round, kissed me full and
fair, and was gone with a flutter of skirt and clicking of shoe
heels on the brass ledges of the stair.</p>

<p>The last we saw of San José was a lonely boat and a
woman waving and waving till she faded in the dusk and
distance.</p>


<p class="center">THE END.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="SPANISH_CEDAR_LOGS" id="SPANISH_CEDAR_LOGS">SPANISH CEDAR LOGS.</a></h2>


<p>In the early days of cigar box manufacture in California,
they were made almost exclusively of Spanish cedar. But
that wood has become very scarce and high priced of late
years, and other woods are taking its place to a certain
extent.</p>

<p>And one of those woods is California redwood. In California
at present the cigar box makers use about one-fourth
redwood; the balance is composed of Spanish cedar and what
is known to the trade as "imitation" lumber, which is nothing
more than the common poplar and basswood of New
England, sawed up, planed, and then stained in imitation of
Spanish cedar, or veneered with Spanish cedar, because
Spanish cedar is par excellence the real stuff for cigar
boxes.</p>

<p>The gilt edge cigars all have to be packed in Spanish
cedar, else there is a kick from the opulent and fastidious
smoker, who claims that the natural aroma of the wood
imparts an improved flavor to the cigars.</p>

<p>This may be a superstition, but as the well-to-do lovers
of the weed are perfectly willing to pay for it the trade are
only too anxious to flatter their customers' tastes.</p>

<p>It is a luxury and one that is growing more and more
expensive; for in the early days of cigar box making Spanish
cedar could be bought at $55 a thousand feet; now it
costs $95 a thousand feet.</p>

<p>Now some one asks where and how is Spanish cedar obtained?
Right here on the Pacific coast; but not in California,
however, replete as her resources are. You have
to go away south along the Mexican and Central American
coasts for this special kind of lumber. And California has
driven a trade in Spanish cedar ever since cigar box making
had its inception on the Pacific coast; in fact, there is
hardly a product of any part of the known world that does
not come to the port by the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>The ever restless coasting schooners are the craft that
bring our Spanish cedar logs up out of the tropics, and it is
a peculiar trade&mdash;not only the maritime part of the traffic,
but that part which is performed on land; for that part is
done along the primitive ways of the easy going Mexican
and Central American.</p>

<p>It is to be presumed that away back in the early days of
maritime traffic on the lower coast there were supplies of
Spanish cedar logs that could be obtained at the regular
ports of entry; but evidently such a supply, if it ever existed,
finally became exhausted, and as nobody down in those
regions had the enterprise to build railroads from their seaports
into the lumber regions of the interior, the stock of
cedar had to be picked up all along the coast, wherever the
wood could be found. That made the transfer of the logs
from the shore to the vessel's side a very laborious undertaking
and one no white man would ever have thought of
resorting to.</p>

<p>But first in order comes the cutting of the cedar timber
and the transportation of the logs to the shore. This, too,
was done by the simple-minded Mexicans and Central Americans.
Of course, at first these people cut the timber nearest
the seashore, and then kept working back into the country,
a process that involved more and more labor, because the
distance of transportation was all the time increasing.</p>

<p>The cedar trees were chopped down and then cut up into
logs varying in length from six to twelve feet, according to
the size of the trees. These logs were then hewn square,
ranging in size from nine inches to two feet.</p>

<p>This was done in order that they might be packed closely
when on board of the California schooners. Then along
came a swarthy Castilian, a pair of oxen attached to one
of those funny wooden two-wheeled carts, with axle bare.</p>

<p>Upon this cart, called a carita, were loaded a number of
logs, the number, of course, depending upon the size, and
were lashed on, with one end dragging upon the ground
behind. In this way the logs were hauled to the sea coast
and deposited just above high tide line. After a while Spanish
cedar began to grow scarce along the ocean belt, and then
the Mexicans went up the rivers and creeks and cut cedar
timber along the banks. The logs were rolled into the
streams and driven down to the sea, either loose or in rafts,
and were loaded thence upon the California schooners.</p>

<p>Now, there was a certain season when the loading of
cedar logs down along the southern coast upon the schooners
from the north was practicable, and that was in what California
calls the winter season, when in southern waters the
weather is the calmest of any season during the year. For
there were no deep water harbors or extensive ocean piers
whereat to find dockage for the schooners, and the loading
had to be done offshore at any point where there might be
a quantity of logs awaiting shipment. So the California
sailing masters used to go cruising down the southern coast,
keeping a sharp lookout for signals from ashore indicating
the presence of a cargo. At a given signal they would tack
to larboard and pull in as close to the beach as the soundings
would permit. Sometimes they would have to anchor as
much as two miles offshore.</p>

<p>When all was ready for loading two of the Mexicans on
shore would seize a log, watch for the next incoming comber,
and just as it was about to break on the beach they
would start, rush through it with their log in hand, and
would then find themselves in comparatively smooth water.</p>

<p>As soon as deep water was reached the two men would
start to paddle the log out to the waiting vessel. There was
a man on each side of the log, and each man had one arm
flung over the log, while the other was left free to do the
paddling. Arriving at the vessel's side the log would be
caught by the crew of the craft and pulled on board. The
two swimmers would then turn about and swim back to the
shore for another log. By this slow and laborious process
the vessel was finally loaded, the logs paid for, and the prow
turned northward.</p>

<p>For this kind of labor the Mexicans were paid $1 a day
each in Mexican money, worth only about fifty cents in
United States currency. But the Mexicans appeared to be
quite well satisfied with their wages, and could save something
out of their pay for a rainy day; because living was
cheap in that kindly climate&mdash;a bunch of bananas and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
cakes sufficing for food, with mescal to drink, and anyone
could sleep out of doors under a palm tree with perfect
comfort.</p>

<p>The traffic in Spanish cedar logs has fallen off a good deal
of late years in consequence of their growing scarcity, and
California cigar box makers have been obliged to send to
eastern seaports for a part of their supply, the lumber finding
its way into those ports from Cuba and Gulf of Mexico
ports.</p>

<h2><a name="COOKING_THE_VENISON_STEAK" id="COOKING_THE_VENISON_STEAK">COOKING THE VENISON STEAK.</a></h2>


<p>There are various ways of cooking venison steak, but the
recipe given by Game Warden Walter Neal is still pronounced
the best by Maine woodsmen. It is that followed by
Hannibal Hamlin and other famous hunters and diners.</p>

<p>"Get a buck deer that is fat and not over five years of
age," says Mr. Neal. "One that weighs one hundred pounds
is better than no deer, though the best should weigh nearly
two hundred pounds. Before the body is cold, if possible,
slash off some thick slices of steak. Have them nearly two
inches thick and big enough to cover the bottom of an old-style
spider if possible.</p>

<p>"Now get a thick and heavy cast-iron spider red-hot above
the coals. Be sure and do this, because the hotter the spider
is the better. And when the spider is glowing and sparkling
with heat, slap in a slice of steak. Do not use any butter
or any form of fat, but let the raw meat fall direct upon
the hot iron, and then let it sizzle and smell and smoke for
about a minute.</p>

<p>"Now flop it over on the other side, and repeat until the
camp is so full of choking smoke and the smell of burning
meat that you must carry the heated spider outdoors to get
your breath.</p>

<p>"Tip the burnt and smoking steak on to a big plate, slash
it deeply all over the surface with a sharp knife and throw
on butter until the meat is afloat. Then salt and pepper to
taste, after which nobody needs any directions as to what to
do next.</p>

<p>"Venison cooked in this way and eaten with strong coffee
and hot cream of tartar biscuit forms the best meat that it
is possible to serve to kings and queens or jacks. And I
know exactly what I am talking about."</p>

<p>The market men and hotel cooks of eastern Maine make
a sharp distinction between the flesh of the deer that is
raised in Maine and that which is captured by the hunters
in the Southern States, calling the home product venison and
all other kinds deer meat, or if the animals are very small
and without fat, they modify the term and scornfully call
it deer veal.</p>

<p>The newest Bangor plan of cooking venison is to cut
moderately thick slices from the round of a buck and grill
the flesh over a white-hot fire of anthracite, letting the
greedy flames lick and bathe the curling meat and crisp its
edges until it is hot clear through and cooked on the outside,
though still somewhat rare in the interior.</p>

<p>The person who is said to have introduced this manner of
cooking from Canada is Edward Stetson, president of the
First National Bank of Bangor, who spends much time every
year in his camp back from North Twin Dam on the west
branch of Penobscot River. So particular is Mr. Stetson
concerning how the venison of his shooting must be prepared
for his guests in camp that before the beginning of open
season every year he sends up the necessary anthracite by
rail, his servants carrying it in baskets from the station
far back into the wilderness, where it is used solely for
broiling venison.</p>

<p>The men of unclassified employment who pass from May
to October in raising hay, oats and potatoes to sell to the
near-by lumber camps and who swing axes in the deep
woods from October to May declare that the best venison is
from the carcass of a buck shot in November and frozen and
hung up under cover until midwinter.</p>

<h2><a name="BABY_OSTRICHES" id="BABY_OSTRICHES">BABY OSTRICHES.</a></h2>


<p>Three cunning little gray-and-white ostriches were ushered
into the world at the Florida Ostrich Farm and Zoo recently,
a remarkably good result from a setting of fifteen eggs.
Everybody, from Manager Fraser down to the most subordinate
attaché of the resort, was gloriously happy over the
event.</p>

<p>The life, habits, and characteristics of the ostriches are
really interesting. Starting with the mating of the grown
birds, which are allowed to select their mates, the male
bird prepares the nest, a hollow in the sand, generally in a
secluded spot in his pen, about one and a half feet deep and
twelve feet in circumference. The hen lays about twelve
to eighteen eggs, one every other day. The eggs are from
fifteen to eighteen inches in circumference, and, weigh about
three to four and a half pounds each, the shell being from
one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch thick, sufficiently
strong to withstand a decided blow. After laying her nest
of eggs the birds begin setting, the hen in the daytime and
the male ostrich covering the eggs at nighttime. They remain
on the nests constantly from forty-two to forty-five
days, never leaving it, except for food twice a day. Even
then the male bird covers the nest frequently while his mate
seeks her food.</p>

<p>The chick when ready to hatch will usually break or pip
the shell itself; but at times the hen ostrich will assist by
breaking it with her breast bone, by pressing upon it, helping
the chick out by lifting it out with her beak, and shaking
the shell from its body.</p>

<p>The first growth of ostrich chicks is remarkably fast, as
from ten days of age up to six months old they grow at the
rate of a foot a month. After six months they grow more
slowly.</p>

<p>At first both sexes are similar in color and appearance,
and are almost undistinguishable until about fifteen or eighteen
months old. That which has been a mixture of drab,
white, and brown on the male, begins to darken, and finally
at about four years old becomes a decided black. The
feathers on the female remain drab during her entire life.
Baby ostriches do not eat for three days after hatching. The
third day they begin to stand up and take notice like a child,
and after being taught to eat by having bits of their food
placed in their bills, they very quickly discover the use of
their bills, and pick up their own food.</p>

<p>The chicks must be carefully fed and have fine especially
prepared food, including plenty of fine grit and fresh, clean
water. Their first crop of feathers matures at eight months.</p>

<h2><a name="MINK_FARM_IN_OREGON" id="MINK_FARM_IN_OREGON">MINK FARM IN OREGON.</a></h2>


<p>Tom Staten has established a farm for the raising of
mink at Rattlesnake Point, on the upper Klamath Lake.
About a hundred of the animals are housed in cages or cabinets,
and seem to do well and thrive in captivity, as they
are all fat and sleek looking.</p>

<p>The animals are so tame that they will take food from
the hand, although one has to be careful in handling them,
as the mink is treacherous and has very sharp teeth. As
mink in this county increase about five fold Mr. Staten
expects to have something over five hundred in his cages
next year. The value of their fur alone will aggregate about
$3,000, but live female minks sell for a much higher figure
than their hide alone is worth.</p>

<p>The boys who want to learn something from what they read, as
well as to be interested by it, will never find another publication
that will satisfy them so well as MOTOR STORIES. "Motor
Matt" is not an impossible boy character. He is simply a youth who
has had considerable training in a machine shop where motors of all
kinds were repaired, and who is possessed of a genius for mechanics.
His sense of right and wrong is strongly developed, and his endeavors
to insure certain people a square deal, lead him into a series of the
most astonishing, but at the same time the most natural adventures
that ever befell a boy.</p>
